# Template Sequence List

Complete list of 36 Template sequences with sequence numbers and generalized descriptions.

Sequence numbers follow the format: `S{{seq_num}}` where seq_num ranges from 01 to 36.
Template Sequences are organized into three categories: Category 1 (1-15), Category 2 (16-28), and Category 3 (29-36).

## Overview

Pattern sequences are coherent flows of related patterns that work together to create **emergent phenomena** - properties that arise from the synergy of patterns rather than from any single pattern alone. Each sequence represents a design algorithm that guides the development process from large-scale decisions to detailed refinements.

## Category Organization

### Category 1: Large-scale Organization (Sequences 1-15)
**Scale**: Macro to intermediate level (Patterns 1-94)

Large-scale patterns that establish the fundamental structure of organized systems, from broad domains down to local contexts. These patterns ensure balanced distribution of elements, preservation of essential systems, and creation of identifiable contexts.

**Emergent Properties**: Create coherent systems with clear identity and structure.

### Category 2: Medium-scale Organization (Sequences 16-28)
**Scale**: Structural complex to component level (Patterns 95-204)

Medium-scale patterns that guide the design of individual structures and structural groups. These patterns create frameworks that support core activities, facilitate interaction, and connect meaningfully with their environment.

**Emergent Properties**: Generate frameworks that support activity and interaction.

### Category 3: Small-scale Organization (Sequences 29-36)
**Scale**: Implementation to detail level (Patterns 205-253)

Small-scale patterns that specify the detailed implementation and material aspects. These patterns bring structures to completion, ensuring operational integrity while creating coherence and harmony.

**Emergent Properties**: Produce concrete realizations that embody systematic intentions.

## Template Reference Format

Each sequence can be referenced using its template identifier:
- **Format**: `S{{seq_num}}` where seq_num is a two-digit number (01-36)
- **Example**: S01 refers to "Independent domains"
- **File Reference**: Each sequence has a corresponding markdown file in `markdown/sequences/seq{{num}}.md`

## Usage

This list provides a complete overview of all pattern sequences in the template form. Use this reference to:
1. Navigate between sequences
2. Understand sequence organization and hierarchy
3. Map sequences to their corresponding pattern ranges
4. Cross-reference with individual pattern templates
