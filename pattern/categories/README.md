> **Pattern 2: Distribution of Towns** - Category data organized by scale

## Overview

This directory contains category-specific pattern definitions organized by Christopher Alexander's three scales: Towns, Buildings, and Construction.

## Contents

### Physical Dimension Categories (dim2)

- `category_towns.json` - Patterns 1-94 (large-scale, regional patterns)
- `category_buildings.json` - Patterns 95-204 (medium-scale, building patterns)
- `category_construction.json` - Patterns 205-253 (small-scale, construction patterns)

## Pattern Language Structure

These three categories reflect the hierarchical organization of the pattern language:

1. **Towns (cat1)**: Large-scale patterns that define regions, cities, and communities
2. **Buildings (cat2)**: Medium-scale patterns that define building structures and spaces
3. **Construction (cat3)**: Small-scale patterns that define details and construction methods

## Usage

These files provide:
- Category-specific pattern listings
- Scale-appropriate organization
- Foundation for multi-dimensional pattern navigation

## Related Content

- `../../markdown/sequences/` - Pattern sequences that span categories
- `../../docs/` - Documentation about pattern categories

## Pattern 2: Logarithmic Distribution

The three categories follow Pattern 2's logarithmic principle:
- **Towns**: Fewest patterns (94) at largest scale
- **Buildings**: Medium number (110) at medium scale  
- **Construction**: Most patterns (49) at smallest scale

This creates a stable distribution that mirrors natural settlement patterns.
