# 12610400 - Integrating the historical dimension

## Template

When a domain is properly formed it encodes the earlier stages in its own development, appropriately relating them to current and emerging stages.

## Physical

When an urban environment is properly designed it preserves structures reflecting the characteristics of its earlier stages of development, appropriately relating them to recent buildings and those planned or in process of construction.

## Social

When a social group or organizational complex is properly balanced it integrates within it traditional groups (or elderly people), appropriately relating them to contemporary groups (or adults) as well as to new kinds of groups (or the young). Failure to do so creates dangerous rifts in the sense of historical continuity and development within the community.

## Conceptual

When a conceptual domain is properly formed and balanced it integrates within it the earlier stages in its own development, appropriately relating them to currently accepted concepts and to emerging insights into the probable future development of the domain.

## Individual

When a mode of awareness is properly balanced it integrates within it the earlier learning stages in its own development appropriately relating them to those in which confidence is at present placed, as well as to those emerging insights which are as yet only partially understood.
