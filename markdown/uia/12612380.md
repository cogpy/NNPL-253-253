# 12612380 - Filtered insights

## Template

Unmediated sources of illumination result in strong contrasts, over-emphasizing boundaries and making it difficult to detect detail.

## Physical

Light filtered through a window partially covered by leaves or tracery enhances a sense of well-being in contrast to the dullness associated with uniform lighting. Glare around the window is also reduced by softening the light in this way.

## Social

Diffusing the underlying intention of an organization through spontaneously occurring events enhances the organic well-being of the group in contrast to the over-programmed dullness associated with an omnipresent objective. Unnecessary tension is also reduced by indirection of the trend.

## Conceptual

Diluting a fundamental insight by representing it through random phenomena of apparently superficial significance enhances appreciation of its value. Presentation of an insight in undiluted form results in harsh contrasts which make if difficult to accept.

## Individual
