# 12612410 - Attractive temporary positions

## Template

For a temporary position to be attractive, due consideration must be given to the viewpoint it offers, its exposure to agreeable influences, and its proximity to focii of more permanent concern.

## Physical

Outdoor seats, whether public or private, are useless unless they are positioned with due regard for view and climate.

## Social

Organizations can usefully permit the emergence of temporary roles which offer participants the opportunity of withdrawing from formal activity, whether to cultivate a sense of perspective, or as a safety valve through which the tensions of organization life may be reduced.

## Conceptual

Conceptual frameworks can usefully recognize the value of temporary viewpoints, not necessarily associated with any particular framework, from which a sense of perspective may be obtained concerning ongoing conceptual activity. Such viewpoints will not however be taken up unless their inherent interest is recognized.

## Individual

Temporary modes of awareness may be usefully adopted as a means of acquiring a sense of perspective on those adopted on a more frequent and regular basis.
