## Metadata

- **Category**: Towns

## Overview

Sequence 11 focuses on public open land

## Emergent Phenomena

Public spaces that provide access to nature and opportunities for recreation and gathering

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 7 patterns:

1. **Pattern 58: CARNIVAL**
   - Addresses: Just as an individual person dreams fantastic happenings to release the inner forces which cannot be encompassed by ordinary events, so too a city needs its dreams.

2. **Pattern 59: QUIET BACKS**
   - Addresses: Any one who has to work in noise, in offices with people all around, needs to be able to pause and refresh himself with quiet in a more natural situation.

3. **Pattern 60: ACCESSIBLE GREEN**
   - Addresses: People need green open places to go to; when they are close they use them. But if the greens are more than three minutes away, the distance overwhelms the need.

4. **Pattern 61: SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES**
   - Addresses: A town needs public squares; they are the largest, most public rooms, that the town has. But when they are too large, they look and feel deserted.

5. **Pattern 62: HIGH PLACES**
   - Addresses: The instinct to climb up to some high place, from which you can look down and survey your world, seems to be a fundamental human instinct.

6. **Pattern 63: DANCING IN THE STREETS**
   - Addresses: Why is it that people don't dance in the streets today?

7. **Pattern 64: POOLS AND STREAMS**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.


The sequence flows from carnival to pools and streams, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **CARNIVAL**: Just as an individual person dreams fantastic happenings to release the inner forces which cannot be encompassed by ordinary events, so too a city needs its dreams.

2. **QUIET BACKS**: Any one who has to work in noise, in offices with people all around, needs to be able to pause and refresh himself with quiet in a more natural situation.

3. **ACCESSIBLE GREEN**: People need green open places to go to; when they are close they use them. But if the greens are more than three minutes away, the distance overwhelms the need.

4. **SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES**: A town needs public squares; they are the largest, most public rooms, that the town has. But when they are too large, they look and feel deserted.

5. **HIGH PLACES**: The instinct to climb up to some high place, from which you can look down and survey your world, seems to be a fundamental human instinct.

6. **DANCING IN THE STREETS**: Why is it that people don't dance in the streets today?

7. **POOLS AND STREAMS**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **CARNIVAL**: Set aside some part of the town as a carnival - mad side-shows, tournaments, acts, displays, competitions, dancing, music, street theater, clowns, transvestites, freak events, which allow people to reveal their madness; weave a wide pedestrian street through this area; run booths along the street, narrow alleys; at one end an outdoor theater; perhaps connect the theater stage directly to the carnival street, so the two spill into and feed one another.

2. **QUIET BACKS**: Give the buildings in the busy parts of town a quiet "back" behind them and away from the noise. Build a walk along this quiet back, far enough from the building so that it gets full sunlight, but protected from noise by walls and distance and buildings. Make certain that the path is not a natural shortcut for busy foot traffic, and connect it up with other walks, to form a long ribbon of quiet alleyways which converge on the local pools and streams and the local greens.

3. **ACCESSIBLE GREEN**: Build one open public green within three minutes' walk - about 750 feet - of every house and workplace. This means that the greens need to be uniformly scattered at 1500-f0ot intervals, throughout the city. Make the greens at least 150 feet across, and at least 60,000 square feet in area.

4. **SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES**: Make a public square much smaller than you would at first imagine; usually no more than 45 to 60 feet across, never more than 70 feet across. This applies only to its width in the short direction. In the long direction it can certainly be longer.

5. **HIGH PLACES**: Build occasional high places as landmarks throughout the city. They can be a natural part of the topography, or towers, or part of the roofs of the highest local buildingbut, in any case, they should include a physical climb.

6. **DANCING IN THE STREETS**: Along promenades, in squares and evening centers, make a slightly raised platform to form a bandstand, where street musicians and local bands can play. Cover it, and perhaps build in at ground level tiny stalls for refreshment. Surround the bandstand with paved surface for dancing -- no admission charge.

7. **POOLS AND STREAMS**: ## Problem

We came from the water; our bodies are largely water; and water plays a fundamental role in our psychology. We need constant access to water, all around us; and we cannot have it without reverence for water in all its forms. But everywhere in cities water is out of reach.


## Relationship to Towns Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Large-scale urban planning, regional development, community structure, and public spaces

**Purpose**: These patterns establish the fundamental structure of human settlements from regions down to neighborhoods, ensuring balanced distribution of population, preservation of natural systems, and creation of identifiable communities.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Towns patterns form the foundation of the pattern language, creating the overall framework within which buildings and construction details must fit.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence contributes to the Towns category by establishing patterns at the Regional to neighborhood scale (Patterns 1-94) level. As a mid-level sequence, it develops specific aspects of urban life and infrastructure.

The sequence includes 7 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Towns sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 11 of 15 sequences in Towns category
- **Scope**: Refinement patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Towns sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence establishes constraints and context for Buildings patterns:
- Sets spatial boundaries and site conditions
- Defines community context and social requirements
- Establishes circulation and access frameworks

The patterns in this sequence must be considered before detailed building design begins, as they establish the essential context within which buildings will exist.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Towns category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During regional planning and urban development
- When establishing community structure and character
- At the beginning of large-scale design processes

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
