## Overview

Sequence 24 focuses on knit the inside of the building to the outside

## Emergent Phenomena

Buildings that open to and engage with their surroundings rather than turning inward

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 11 patterns:

1. **Pattern 172: GARDEN GROWING WILD**
   - Addresses: A garden which grows true to its own laws is not a wilderness, yet not entirely artificial either.

2. **Pattern 173: GARDEN WALL**
   - Addresses: Gardens and small public parks don't give enough relief from noise unless they are well protected.

3. **Pattern 174: TRELLISED WALK**
   - Addresses: Trellised walks have their own special beauty. They are so unique, so different from other ways of shaping a path, that they are almost archetypal.

4. **Pattern 175: GREENHOUSE**
   - Addresses: Many efforts are being made to harness solar energy by converting it into hot water or electric power. And yet the easiest way to harness solar energy is the most obvious and the oldest: namely, to tr...

5. **Pattern 176: GARDEN SEAT**
   - Addresses: Somewhere in every garden, there must be at least one spot, a quiet garden seat, in which a person - or two people - can reach into themselves and be in touch with nothing else but nature.

6. **Pattern 177: VEGETABLE GARDEN**
   - Addresses: In a healthy town every family can grow vegetables for itself. The time is past to think of this as a hobby for enthusiasts; it is a fundamental part of human life.

7. **Pattern 178: COMPOST**
   - Addresses: Our current ways of getting rid of sewage poison the great bodies of natural water, and rob the land around our buildings of the nutrients they need.

8. **Pattern 179: ALCOVES**
   - Addresses: No homogeneous room, of homogeneous height, can serve a group of people well. To give a group a chance to be together, as a group, a room must also give them the chance to be alone, in one's and two's...

9. **Pattern 180: WINDOW PLACE**
   - Addresses: Everybody loves window seats, bay windows, and big windows with low sills and comfortable chairs drawn up to them.

10. **Pattern 181: THE FIRE**
   - Addresses: There is no substitute for fire.

11. **Pattern 182: EATING ATMOSPHERE**
   - Addresses: When people eat together, they may actually be together in spirit - or they may be far apart. Some rooms invite people to eat leisurely and comfortably and feel together, while others force people to ...


The sequence flows from garden growing wild to eating atmosphere, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **GARDEN GROWING WILD**: A garden which grows true to its own laws is not a wilderness, yet not entirely artificial either.

2. **GARDEN WALL**: Gardens and small public parks don't give enough relief from noise unless they are well protected.

3. **TRELLISED WALK**: Trellised walks have their own special beauty. They are so unique, so different from other ways of shaping a path, that they are almost archetypal.

4. **GREENHOUSE**: Many efforts are being made to harness solar energy by converting it into hot water or electric power. And yet the easiest way to harness solar energy is the most obvious and the oldest: namely, to trap the heat inside a greenhouse and use it for growing flowers and vegetables.

5. **GARDEN SEAT**: Somewhere in every garden, there must be at least one spot, a quiet garden seat, in which a person - or two people - can reach into themselves and be in touch with nothing else but nature.

6. **VEGETABLE GARDEN**: In a healthy town every family can grow vegetables for itself. The time is past to think of this as a hobby for enthusiasts; it is a fundamental part of human life.

7. **COMPOST**: Our current ways of getting rid of sewage poison the great bodies of natural water, and rob the land around our buildings of the nutrients they need.

8. **ALCOVES**: No homogeneous room, of homogeneous height, can serve a group of people well. To give a group a chance to be together, as a group, a room must also give them the chance to be alone, in one's and two's in the same space.

9. **WINDOW PLACE**: Everybody loves window seats, bay windows, and big windows with low sills and comfortable chairs drawn up to them.

10. **THE FIRE**: There is no substitute for fire.

11. **EATING ATMOSPHERE**: When people eat together, they may actually be together in spirit - or they may be far apart. Some rooms invite people to eat leisurely and comfortably and feel together, while others force people to eat as quickly as possible so they can go somewhere else to relax.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **GARDEN GROWING WILD**: Grow grasses, mosses, bushes, flowers, and trees in a way which comes close to the way that they occur in nature: intermingled, without barriers between them, without bare earth, without formal flower beds, and with all the boundaries and edges made in rough stone and brick and wood which become a part of the natural growth.

2. **GARDEN WALL**: Form some kind of enclosure to protect the interior of a quiet garden from the sights and sounds of passing traffic. If it is a large garden or a park, the enclosure can be soft, can include bushes, trees, slopes, and so on. The smaller the garden, however, the harder and more definite the enclosure must become. In a very small garden, form the enclosure with buildings or walls; even hedges and fences will not be enough to keep out sound.

3. **TRELLISED WALK**: Where paths need special protection or where they need some intimacy, build a trellis over the path and plant it with climbing flowers. Use the trellis to help shape the outdoor spaces on either side of it.

4. **GREENHOUSE**: In temperate climates, build a greenhouse as part of your house or office, so that it is both a "room" of the house which can be reached directly without going outdoors and a part of the garden which can be reached directly from the garden.

5. **GARDEN SEAT**: Make a quiet place in the garden - a private enclosure with a comfortable seat, thick planting, sun. Pick the place for the seat carefully; pick the place that will give you the most intense kind of solitude.

6. **VEGETABLE GARDEN**: Set aside one piece of land either in the private garden or on common land as a vegetable garden. About one-tenth of an acre is needed for each family of four. Make sure the vegetable garden is in a sunny place and central to all the households it serves. Fence it in and build a small storage shed for gardening tools beside it.

7. **COMPOST**: Arrange all toilets over a dry composting chamber. Lead organic garbage chutes to the same chamber, and use the combined products for fertflizer.

8. **ALCOVES**: Make small places at the edge of any common room, usually no more than 6 feet wide and 3 to 6 feet deep and possibly much smaller. These alcoves should be large enough for two people to sit, chat, or play and sometimes large enough to contain a desk or a table.

9. **WINDOW PLACE**: In every room where you spend any length of time during the day, make at least one window into a "window place."

10. **THE FIRE**: Build the fire in a common space - perhaps in the kitchen - where it provides a natural focus for talk and dreams and thought. Adjust the location until it knits together the social spaces and rooms around it, giving them each a glimpse of the fire; and make a window or some other focus to sustain the place during the times when the fire is out.

11. **EATING ATMOSPHERE**: Put a heavy table in the center of the eating space - large enough for the whole family or the group of people using it. Put a light over the table to create a pool of light over the group, and enclose the space with walls or with contrasting darkness. Make the space large enough so the chairs can be pulled back comfortably, and provide shelves and counters close at hand for things related to the meal.


## Relationship to Buildings Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Building arrangement, spatial organization, room configuration, and indoor-outdoor transitions

**Purpose**: These patterns guide the design of individual buildings and building groups, creating spaces that support human activities, facilitate social interaction, and connect meaningfully with their surroundings.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Buildings patterns bridge between the large-scale structure established by Towns patterns and the detailed construction specified by Construction patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence operates at the Building complex to room scale (Patterns 95-204) level within the Buildings category. It addresses the internal organization and refinement of building spaces.

The sequence includes 11 patterns, representing a comprehensive design process within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Buildings sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 9 of 13 sequences in Buildings category
- **Scope**: Refinement patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Buildings sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence bridges between Towns and Construction:
- **From Towns**: Inherits site conditions, community context, and spatial constraints
- **To Construction**: Provides spatial requirements, structural implications, and material needs

The patterns operate at the critical middle scale where urban context meets physical construction.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Buildings category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During building design and site planning
- When organizing spaces and circulation
- After Towns patterns establish context

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
