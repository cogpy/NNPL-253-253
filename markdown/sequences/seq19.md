## Overview

Sequence 19 focuses on paths and squares

## Emergent Phenomena

Pedestrian circulation that creates opportunities for encounter and makes spaces feel alive

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 12 patterns:

1. **Pattern 120: PATHS AND GOALS**
   - Addresses: The layout of paths will seem right and comfortable only when it is compatible with the process of walking. And the process of walking is far more subtle than one might imagine.

2. **Pattern 121: PATH SHAPE**
   - Addresses: Streets should be for staying in, and not just for moving through, the way they are today.

3. **Pattern 122: BUILDING FRONTS**
   - Addresses: Building set-backs from the street, originally invented to protect the public welfare by giving every building light and air, have actually helped greatly to destroy the street as a social space.

4. **Pattern 123: PEDESTRIAN DENSITY**
   - Addresses: Many of our modern public squares, though intended as lively plazas, are in fact deserted and dead.

5. **Pattern 124: ACTIVITY POCKETS**
   - Addresses: The life of a public square forms naturally around its edge. If the edge fails, then the space never becomes lively.

6. **Pattern 125: STAIR SEATS**
   - Addresses: Wherever there is action in a place, the spots which are the most inviting, are those high enough to give people a vantage point, and low enough to put them in action.

7. **Pattern 126: SOMETHING ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE**
   - Addresses: A public space without a middle is quite likely to stay empty.

8. **Pattern 127: INTIMACY GRADIENT**
   - Addresses: Unless the spaces in a building are arranged in a sequence which corresponds to their degrees of privateness, the visits made by strangers, friends, guests, clients, family, will always be a little aw...

9. **Pattern 128: INDOOR SUNLIGHT**
   - Addresses: If the right rooms are facing south, a house is bright and sunny and cheerful; if the wrong rooms are facing south, the house is dark and gloomy.

10. **Pattern 129: COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART**
   - Addresses: No social group - whether a family, a work group, or a school group - can survive without constant informal contact among its members.

11. **Pattern 130: ENTRANCE ROOM**
   - Addresses: Arriving in a building, or leaving it, you need a room to pass through, both inside the building and outside it. This is the entrance room.

12. **Pattern 131: THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS**
   - Addresses: The movement between rooms is as important as the rooms themselves; and its arrangement has as much effect on social interaction in the rooms, as the interiors of the rooms.


The sequence flows from paths and goals to the flow through rooms, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **PATHS AND GOALS**: The layout of paths will seem right and comfortable only when it is compatible with the process of walking. And the process of walking is far more subtle than one might imagine.

2. **PATH SHAPE**: Streets should be for staying in, and not just for moving through, the way they are today.

3. **BUILDING FRONTS**: Building set-backs from the street, originally invented to protect the public welfare by giving every building light and air, have actually helped greatly to destroy the street as a social space.

4. **PEDESTRIAN DENSITY**: Many of our modern public squares, though intended as lively plazas, are in fact deserted and dead.

5. **ACTIVITY POCKETS**: The life of a public square forms naturally around its edge. If the edge fails, then the space never becomes lively.

6. **STAIR SEATS**: Wherever there is action in a place, the spots which are the most inviting, are those high enough to give people a vantage point, and low enough to put them in action.

7. **SOMETHING ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE**: A public space without a middle is quite likely to stay empty.

8. **INTIMACY GRADIENT**: Unless the spaces in a building are arranged in a sequence which corresponds to their degrees of privateness, the visits made by strangers, friends, guests, clients, family, will always be a little awkward.

9. **INDOOR SUNLIGHT**: If the right rooms are facing south, a house is bright and sunny and cheerful; if the wrong rooms are facing south, the house is dark and gloomy.

10. **COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART**: No social group - whether a family, a work group, or a school group - can survive without constant informal contact among its members.

11. **ENTRANCE ROOM**: Arriving in a building, or leaving it, you need a room to pass through, both inside the building and outside it. This is the entrance room.

12. **THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS**: The movement between rooms is as important as the rooms themselves; and its arrangement has as much effect on social interaction in the rooms, as the interiors of the rooms.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **PATHS AND GOALS**: To lay out paths, first place goals at natural points of interest. Then connect the goals to one another to form the paths. The paths may be straight, or gently curving between goals; their paving should swell around the goal. The goals should never be more than a few hundred feet apart.

2. **PATH SHAPE**: Make a bulge in the middle of a public path, and make the ends narrower, so that the path forms an enclosure which is a place to stay, not just a place to pass through.

3. **BUILDING FRONTS**: On no account allow set-backs between streets or paths or public open land and the buildings which front on them. The set-backs do nothing valuable and almost always destroy the value of the open areas between the buildings. Build right up to the paths; change the laws in all communities where obsolete by-laws make this impossible. And let the building fronts take on slightly uneven angles as they accommodate to the shape of the street.

4. **PEDESTRIAN DENSITY**: For public squares, courts, pedestrian streets, any place where crowds are drawn together, estimate the mean number of people in the place at any given moment (P), and make the area of the place between 150P and 300P square feet.

5. **ACTIVITY POCKETS**: Surround public gathering places with pockets of activity - small, partly enclosed areas at the edges, which jut forward into the open space between the paths, and contain activities which make it natural for people to pause and get involved.

6. **STAIR SEATS**: In any public place where people loiter, add a few steps at the edge where stairs come down or where there is a change of level. Make these raised areas immediately accessible from below, so that people may congregate and sit to watch the goings-on.

7. **SOMETHING ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE**: Between the natural paths which cross a public square or courtyard or a piece of common land choose something to stand roughly in the middle: a fountain, a tree, a statue, a clock-tower with seats, a windmill, a bandstand. Make it something which gives a strong and steady pulse to the square, drawing people in toward the center. Leave it exactly where it falls between the paths; resist the impulse to put it exactly in the middle.

8. **INTIMACY GRADIENT**: Lay out the spaces of a building so that they create a sequence which begins with the entrance and the most public parts of the building, then leads into the slightly more private areas, and finally to the most private domains.

9. **INDOOR SUNLIGHT**: Place the most important rooms along the south edge of the building, and spread the building out along the east-west axis. Fine tune the arrangement so that the proper rooms are exposed to the south-east and the south-west sun. For example: give the common area a full southern exposure, bedrooms south-east, porch south-west. For most climates, this means the shape of the building is elongated east-west.

10. **COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART**: Create a single common area for every social group. Locate it at the center of gravity of all the spaces the group occupies, and in such a way that the paths which go in and out of the building lie tangent to it.

11. **ENTRANCE ROOM**: At the main entrance to a building, make a light-filled room which marks the entrance and straddles the boundary between indoors and outdoors, covering some space outdoors and some space indoors. The outside part may be like an old-fashioned porch; the inside like a hall or sitting room.

12. **THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS**: As far as possible, avoid the use of corridors and passages. Instead, use public rooms and common rooms as rooms for movement and for gathering. To do this, place the common rooms to form a chain, or loop, so that it becomes possible to walk from room to room - and so that private rooms open directly off these public rooms. In every case, give this indoor circulation from room to room a feeling of great generosity, passing in a wide and ample loop around the house, with views of fires and great windows.


## Relationship to Buildings Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Building arrangement, spatial organization, room configuration, and indoor-outdoor transitions

**Purpose**: These patterns guide the design of individual buildings and building groups, creating spaces that support human activities, facilitate social interaction, and connect meaningfully with their surroundings.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Buildings patterns bridge between the large-scale structure established by Towns patterns and the detailed construction specified by Construction patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence operates at the Building complex to room scale (Patterns 95-204) level within the Buildings category. It focuses on the arrangement and positioning of buildings and their outdoor spaces.

The sequence includes 12 patterns, representing a comprehensive design process within this scale range.

### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence bridges between Towns and Construction:
- **From Towns**: Inherits site conditions, community context, and spatial constraints
- **To Construction**: Provides spatial requirements, structural implications, and material needs

The patterns operate at the critical middle scale where urban context meets physical construction.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Buildings category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During building design and site planning
- When organizing spaces and circulation
- After Towns patterns establish context

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
