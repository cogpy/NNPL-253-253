- **Scale**: Building complex to room scale (Patterns 95-204)

## Overview

Sequence 17 focuses on the position of individual buildings

## Emergent Phenomena

Individual buildings positioned to take advantage of site conditions and create good outdoor spaces

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 7 patterns:

1. **Pattern 104: SITE REPAIR**
   - Addresses: Buildings must always be built on those parts of the land which are in the worst condition, not the best.

2. **Pattern 105: SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS**
   - Addresses: People use open space if it is sunny, and do not use it if it isn't, in all but desert climates.

3. **Pattern 106: POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE**
   - Addresses: Outdoor spaces which are merely "left over" between buildings will, in general, not be used.

4. **Pattern 107: WINGS OF LIGHT**
   - Addresses: Modern buildings are often shaped with no concern for natural light - they depend almost entirely on artificial light. But buildings which displace natural light as the major source of illumination ar...

5. **Pattern 108: CONNECTED BUILDINGS**
   - Addresses: Isolated buildings are symptoms of a disconnected sick society.

6. **Pattern 109: LONG THIN HOUSE**
   - Addresses: The shape of a building has a great effect on the relative degrees of privacy and overcrowding in it, and this in turn has a critical effect on people's comfort and well being.

7. **Pattern 110: MAIN ENTRANCE**
   - Addresses: Placing the main entrance (or main entrances) is perhaps the single most important step you take during the evolution of a building plan.


The sequence flows from site repair to main entrance, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **SITE REPAIR**: Buildings must always be built on those parts of the land which are in the worst condition, not the best.

2. **SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS**: People use open space if it is sunny, and do not use it if it isn't, in all but desert climates.

3. **POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE**: Outdoor spaces which are merely "left over" between buildings will, in general, not be used.

4. **WINGS OF LIGHT**: Modern buildings are often shaped with no concern for natural light - they depend almost entirely on artificial light. But buildings which displace natural light as the major source of illumination are not fit places to spend the day.

5. **CONNECTED BUILDINGS**: Isolated buildings are symptoms of a disconnected sick society.

6. **LONG THIN HOUSE**: The shape of a building has a great effect on the relative degrees of privacy and overcrowding in it, and this in turn has a critical effect on people's comfort and well being.

7. **MAIN ENTRANCE**: Placing the main entrance (or main entrances) is perhaps the single most important step you take during the evolution of a building plan.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **SITE REPAIR**: On no account place buildings in the places which are most beautiful. In fact, do the opposite. Consider the site and its buildings as a single living eco-system. Leave those areas that are the most precious, beautiful, comfortable, and healthy as they are, and build new structures in those parts of the site which are least pleasant now.

2. **SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS**: Always place buildings to the north of the outdoor spaces that go with them, and keep the outdoor spaces to the south. Never leave a deep band of shade between the building and the sunny part of the outdoors.

3. **POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE**: Make all the outdoor spaces which surround and lie between your buildings positive. Give each one some degree of enclosure; surround each space with wings of buildings, trees, hedges, fences, arcades, and trellised walks, until it becomes an entity with a positive quality and does not spill out indefinitely around corners.

4. **WINGS OF LIGHT**: Arrange each building so that it breaks down into wings which correspond, approximately, to the most important natural social groups within the building. Make each wing long and as narrow as you can - never more than 25 feet wide.

5. **CONNECTED BUILDINGS**: Connect your building up, wherever possible, to the existing buildings round about. Do not keep set backs between buildings; instead, try to form new buildings as continuations of the older buildings.

6. **LONG THIN HOUSE**: In small buildings, don't cluster all the rooms together around each other; instead string out the rooms one after another, so that distance between each room is as great as it can be. You can do this horizontally - so that the plan becomes a thin, long rectangle; or you can do it vertically - so that the building becomes a tall narrow tower. In either case, the building can be surprisingly narrow and still work - 8, 10, and 12 feet are all quite possible.

7. **MAIN ENTRANCE**: Place the main entrance of the building at a point where it can be seen immediately from the main avenues of approach and give it a bold, visible shape which stands out in front of the building.


## Relationship to Buildings Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Building arrangement, spatial organization, room configuration, and indoor-outdoor transitions

**Purpose**: These patterns guide the design of individual buildings and building groups, creating spaces that support human activities, facilitate social interaction, and connect meaningfully with their surroundings.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Buildings patterns bridge between the large-scale structure established by Towns patterns and the detailed construction specified by Construction patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence operates at the Building complex to room scale (Patterns 95-204) level within the Buildings category. It focuses on the arrangement and positioning of buildings and their outdoor spaces.

The sequence includes 7 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Buildings sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 2 of 13 sequences in Buildings category
- **Scope**: Foundational patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Buildings sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence bridges between Towns and Construction:
- **From Towns**: Inherits site conditions, community context, and spatial constraints
- **To Construction**: Provides spatial requirements, structural implications, and material needs

The patterns operate at the critical middle scale where urban context meets physical construction.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Buildings category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During building design and site planning
- When organizing spaces and circulation
- After Towns patterns establish context

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales


## Related Sequences

- **Previous Sequence (16)**: Typically provides broader context or precedes this in design process
- **Next Sequence (18)**: Usually refines or builds upon the foundations laid here
