## Overview

Sequence 18 focuses on entrances, gardens, courtyards, roofs and terraces

## Emergent Phenomena

Transitions between inside and outside that extend the usable space and connect building to site

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 9 patterns:

1. **Pattern 111: HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN**
   - Addresses: If a garden is too close to the street, people won't use it because it isn't private enough. But if it is too far from the street, then it won't be used either, because it is too isolated.

2. **Pattern 112: ENTRANCE TRANSITION**
   - Addresses: Buildings, and especially houses, with a graceful transition between the street and the inside, are more tranquil than those which open directly off the street.

3. **Pattern 113: CAR CONNECTION**
   - Addresses: The process of arriving in a house, and leaving it, is fundamental to our daily fives; and very often it involves a car. But the place where cars connect to houses, far from being important and beauti...

4. **Pattern 114: HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE**
   - Addresses: Outdoors, people always try to find a spot where they can have their backs protected, looking out toward some larger opening, beyond the space immediately in front of them.

5. **Pattern 115: COURTYARDS WHICH LIVE**
   - Addresses: The courtyards built in modern buildings are very often dead. They are intended to be private open spaces for people to use - but they end up unused, full of gravel and abstract sculptures.

6. **Pattern 116: CASCADE OF ROOFS**
   - Addresses: Few buildings will be structurally and socially intact, unless the floors step down toward the ends of wings, and unless the roof, accordingly, forms a cascade.

7. **Pattern 117: SHELTERING ROOF**
   - Addresses: The roof plays a primal role in our lives. The most primitive buildings are nothing but a roof. If the roof is hidden, if its presence cannot be felt around the building, or if it cannot be used, then...

8. **Pattern 118: ROOF GARDEN**
   - Addresses: A vast part of the earth's surface, in a town, consists of roofs. Couple this with the fact that the total area of a town which can be exposed to the sun is finite, and you will realize that is is nat...

9. **Pattern 119: ARCADES**
   - Addresses: Arcades - covered walkways at the edge of buildings, which are partly inside, partly outside - play a vital role in the way that people interact with buildings.


The sequence flows from half-hidden garden to arcades, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN**: If a garden is too close to the street, people won't use it because it isn't private enough. But if it is too far from the street, then it won't be used either, because it is too isolated.

2. **ENTRANCE TRANSITION**: Buildings, and especially houses, with a graceful transition between the street and the inside, are more tranquil than those which open directly off the street.

3. **CAR CONNECTION**: The process of arriving in a house, and leaving it, is fundamental to our daily fives; and very often it involves a car. But the place where cars connect to houses, far from being important and beautiful, is often off to one side and neglected.

4. **HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE**: Outdoors, people always try to find a spot where they can have their backs protected, looking out toward some larger opening, beyond the space immediately in front of them.

5. **COURTYARDS WHICH LIVE**: The courtyards built in modern buildings are very often dead. They are intended to be private open spaces for people to use - but they end up unused, full of gravel and abstract sculptures.

6. **CASCADE OF ROOFS**: Few buildings will be structurally and socially intact, unless the floors step down toward the ends of wings, and unless the roof, accordingly, forms a cascade.

7. **SHELTERING ROOF**: The roof plays a primal role in our lives. The most primitive buildings are nothing but a roof. If the roof is hidden, if its presence cannot be felt around the building, or if it cannot be used, then people will lack a fundamental sense of shelter.

8. **ROOF GARDEN**: A vast part of the earth's surface, in a town, consists of roofs. Couple this with the fact that the total area of a town which can be exposed to the sun is finite, and you will realize that is is natural, and indeed essential, to make roofs which take advantage of the sun and air.

9. **ARCADES**: Arcades - covered walkways at the edge of buildings, which are partly inside, partly outside - play a vital role in the way that people interact with buildings.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN**: Do not place the garden fully in front of the house, nor fully to the back. Instead, place it in some kind of half-way position, side-by-side with the house, in a position which is half-hidden from the street, and half-exposed.

2. **ENTRANCE TRANSITION**: Make a transition space between the street and the front door. Bring the path which connects street and entrance through this transition space, and mark it with a change of light, a change of sound, a change of direction, a change of surface, a change of level, perhaps by gateways which make a change of enclosure, and above all with a change of view.

3. **CAR CONNECTION**: Place the parking place for the car and the main entrance, in such a relation to each other, that the shortest route from the parked car into the house, both to the kitchen and to the living rooms, is always through the main entrance. Make the parking place for the car into an actual room which makes a positive and graceful place where the car stands, not just a gap in the terrain.

4. **HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE**: Whatever space you are shaping - whether it is a garden, terrace, street, park, public outdoor room, or courtyard, make sure of two things. First, make at least one smaller space, which looks into it and forms a natural back for it. Second, place it, and its openings, so that it looks into at least one larger space. When you have done this, every outdoor space will have a natural "back"; and every person who takes up the natural position, with his back to this "back," will be looking out toward some larger distant view.

5. **COURTYARDS WHICH LIVE**: Place every courtyard in such a way that there is a view out of it to some larger open space; place it so that at least two or three doors open from the building into it and so that the natural paths which connect these doors pass across the courtyard. And, at one edge, beside a door, make a roofed veranda or a porch, which is continuous with both the inside and the courtyard.

6. **CASCADE OF ROOFS**: Visualize the whole building, or building complex, as a system of roofs. Place the largest, highest, and widest roofs over those parts of the building which are most significant: when you come to lay the roofs out in detail, you will be able to make all lesser roofs cascade off these large roofs and form a stable self-buttressing system, which is congruent with the hierarchy of social spaces underneath the roofs.

7. **SHELTERING ROOF**: Slope the roof or make a vault of it, make its entire surface visible, and bring the eaves of the roof down low, as low as 6'0" or 6'6" at places like the entrance, where people pause. Build the top story of each wing right into the roof, so that the roof does not only cover it, but actually surrounds it.

8. **ROOF GARDEN**: Make parts of almost every roof system usable as roof gardens. Make these parts flat, perhaps terraced for planting, with places to sit and sleep, private places. Place the roof gardens at various stories, and always make it possible to walk directly out onto the roof garden from some lived-in part of the building.

9. **ARCADES**: Wherever paths run along the edge of buildings, build arcades, and use the arcades, above all, to connect up the buildings to one another, so that a person can walk from place to place under the cover of the arcades.


## Relationship to Buildings Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Building arrangement, spatial organization, room configuration, and indoor-outdoor transitions

**Purpose**: These patterns guide the design of individual buildings and building groups, creating spaces that support human activities, facilitate social interaction, and connect meaningfully with their surroundings.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Buildings patterns bridge between the large-scale structure established by Towns patterns and the detailed construction specified by Construction patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence operates at the Building complex to room scale (Patterns 95-204) level within the Buildings category. It focuses on the arrangement and positioning of buildings and their outdoor spaces.

The sequence includes 9 patterns, representing a comprehensive design process within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Buildings sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 3 of 13 sequences in Buildings category
- **Scope**: Foundational patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Buildings sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence bridges between Towns and Construction:
- **From Towns**: Inherits site conditions, community context, and spatial constraints
- **To Construction**: Provides spatial requirements, structural implications, and material needs

The patterns operate at the critical middle scale where urban context meets physical construction.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Buildings category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During building design and site planning
- When organizing spaces and circulation
- After Towns patterns establish context

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
