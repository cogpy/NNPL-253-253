# Sequence 36: Complete the building

## Metadata

- **Category**: Construction
- **Scale**: Structural system to detail scale (Patterns 205-253)
- **Patterns**: 249, 250, 251, 252, 253
- **Pattern Count**: 5

## Overview

Sequence 36 focuses on complete the building

## Emergent Phenomena

Final elements that give the building its unique character and sense of completion

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 5 patterns:

1. **Pattern 249: ORNAMENT**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

2. **Pattern 250: WARM COLORS**
   - Addresses: The greens and greys of hospitals and office corridors are depressing and cold. Natural wood, sunlight, bright colors are warm. In some way, the warmth of the colors in a room makes a great deal of di...

3. **Pattern 251: DIFFERENT CHAIRS**
   - Addresses: People are different sizes; they sit in different ways. And yet there is a tendency in modern times to make all chairs alike.

4. **Pattern 252: POOLS OF LIGHT**
   - Addresses: Uniform illumination - the sweetheart of the lighting engineers - serves no useful purpose whatsoever. In fact, it destroys the social nature of space, and makes people feel disoriented and unbounded.

5. **Pattern 253: THINGS FROM YOUR LIFE**
   - Addresses: "Decor" and the conception of "interior design" have spread so widely, that very often people forget their instinct for the things they really want to keep around them.


The sequence flows from ornament to things from your life, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **ORNAMENT**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

2. **WARM COLORS**: The greens and greys of hospitals and office corridors are depressing and cold. Natural wood, sunlight, bright colors are warm. In some way, the warmth of the colors in a room makes a great deal of difference between comfort and discomfort.

3. **DIFFERENT CHAIRS**: People are different sizes; they sit in different ways. And yet there is a tendency in modern times to make all chairs alike.

4. **POOLS OF LIGHT**: Uniform illumination - the sweetheart of the lighting engineers - serves no useful purpose whatsoever. In fact, it destroys the social nature of space, and makes people feel disoriented and unbounded.

5. **THINGS FROM YOUR LIFE**: "Decor" and the conception of "interior design" have spread so widely, that very often people forget their instinct for the things they really want to keep around them.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **ORNAMENT**: ## Problem

All people have the instinct to decorate their surroundings.

2. **WARM COLORS**: Choose surface colors which, together with the color of the natural light, reflected light, and artificial lights, create a warm light in the rooms.

3. **DIFFERENT CHAIRS**: Never furnish any place with chairs that are identically the same. Choose a variety of different chairs, some big, some small, some softer than others, some rockers, some very old, some new, with arms, without arms, some wicker, some wood, some cloth.

4. **POOLS OF LIGHT**: Place the lights low, and apart, to form individual pools of light which encompass chairs and tables like bubbles to reinforce the social character of the spaces which they form. Remember that you can't have pools of light without the darker places in between.

5. **THINGS FROM YOUR LIFE**: Do not be tricked into believing that modern decor must be slick or psychedelic, or "natural" or "modern art," or "plants" or anything else that current taste-makers claim. It is most beautiful when it comes straight from your life - the things you care for, the things that tell your story.


## Relationship to Construction Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Structural systems, materials, construction methods, and architectural details

**Purpose**: These patterns specify the physical construction and material details that bring buildings to life, ensuring structural integrity while creating beauty and human comfort.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Construction patterns complete the pattern language by providing the detailed specifications needed to actually build the spaces envisioned in Towns and Buildings patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence works at the Structural system to detail scale (Patterns 205-253) level within the Construction category. It specifies the detailed elements and finishes that complete the construction.

The sequence includes 5 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Construction sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 8 of 8 sequences in Construction category
- **Scope**: Refinement patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Construction sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence realizes the intentions established by Towns and Buildings patterns:
- Translates spatial concepts into physical structure
- Specifies materials and construction methods
- Creates the tactile and visual details that inhabitants experience

These patterns complete the pattern language by making abstract spatial ideas into concrete reality.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Construction category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During construction documentation and detailing
- When specifying materials and methods
- After spatial organization is established

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
