## Overview

Sequence 30 focuses on work out the complete structural layout

## Emergent Phenomena

Coherent structural layouts that efficiently support the intended spatial arrangements

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 5 patterns:

1. **Pattern 209: ROOF LAYOUT**
   - Addresses: What kind of roof plan is organically related to the nature of your building?

2. **Pattern 210: FLOOR AND CEILING LAYOUT**
   - Addresses: Again, the basic problem is to maintain the integrity of the social spaces in the plan.

3. **Pattern 211: THICKENING THE OUTER WALLS**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

4. **Pattern 212: COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS**
   - Addresses: We have already established the idea that the structural components of a building should be congruent with its social spaces.

5. **Pattern 213: FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.


The sequence flows from roof layout to final column distribution, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **ROOF LAYOUT**: What kind of roof plan is organically related to the nature of your building?

2. **FLOOR AND CEILING LAYOUT**: Again, the basic problem is to maintain the integrity of the social spaces in the plan.

3. **THICKENING THE OUTER WALLS**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

4. **COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS**: We have already established the idea that the structural components of a building should be congruent with its social spaces.

5. **FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **ROOF LAYOUT**: Arrange the roofs so that each distinct roof corresponds to an identifiable social entity in the building or building complex. Place the largest roofs - those which are highest and have the largest span - over the largest and most important and most communal spaces; build the lesser roofs off these largest and highest roofs; and build the smallest roofs of all off these lesser roofs, in the form of half-vaults and sheds over alcoves and thick walls.

2. **FLOOR AND CEILING LAYOUT**: Draw a vault plan, for every floor. Use two-way vaults most often; and one-way barrel vaults for any spaces which are more than twice as long as they are wide. Draw sections through the building as you plan the vaults, and bear the following facts in mind: 1. Generally speaking, the vaults should correspond to rooms. 2. There will have to be a support under the sides of each vault: this will usually be the top of a wall. Under exceptional circumstances, it can be a beam or arch. 3. A vault may span as little as 5 feet and as much as 30 feet. However, it must have a rise equal to at least 13 per cent of its shorter span. 4. If the edge of one vault is more than a couple of feet (in plan) from the edge of the vault below it - then the lower vault will have to contain an arch to support the load from the upper vault.

3. **THICKENING THE OUTER WALLS**: ## Discussion

The walls will not usually be thick in the literal sense, except in certain special cases where mud construction, for example, lends itself to the making of walls. More often, the thickness of the wall has to be built up from foam, plaster, columns, struts, and membranes. In this case columns, above all, play the major role, because they do the most to encourage people to develop the walls. For instance, if the framework of a wall is made of columns standing away from the back face of the wall, then the wall invites modification - it becomes natural and easy to nail planks to the columns, and so make seats, and shelves, and changes there. But a pure, flat, blank wall does not give this kind of encouragement. Even though, theoretically, a person can always add things which stick out from the wall, the very smoothness of the wall makes it much less likely to happen. Let us assume then, that a thick wall becomes effective when it is a volume defined by columns. Thick walls made effective by columns. How is it possible for a wall of this kind to justify its expense by helping the structure of the building? The fact that the building is conceived as a compressive structure, whose floors and roofs are vaults -EFFICIENT STRUCTURE (206), means that there are horizontal thrusts developed on the outside of the building, where the vaults do not counterbalance one another. To some extent this horizontal thrust can be avoided by arranging the overall shape of the building as an upside down catenary - see CASCADE OF ROOFS (116). If it were a perfect catenary, there would be no outward thrust at all. Obviously, though, most buildings are narrower and steeper than the ideal structural catenary, so there are horizontal thrusts remaining. Although these thrusts can be resolved by tensile reinforcing in the perimeter beams - see PERIMETER BEAMS (217) - it is simplest, and most natural, and stable to use the building itself to buttress the horizontal thrusts. This possibility occurs naturally wherever there are "thick walls" - alcoves, window seats, or any other small spaces at the outside edge of rooms, which can have lower ceilings than the main room and can therefore have their roofs shaped as continuations of the ceiling vault inside. This requires that thick walls be outside the structure of the main room, so that their roofs and walls come close to forming a catenary with the main vault. Alcoves within the catenary. It is of course rare to be able to have the alcove or thick walls approach a true catenary section - we hardly ever want them that deep or that low. But even when the thick walls and alcoves are inside the line of the catenary, they are still helping to counter outward thrusts. And their buttressing effect can be improved still more by making their roofs heavy. The extra weight will tend to redirect the forces coming from the main vault slightly more toward the ground. The drawing below shows the way this pattern works, and the kind of effect it has on a building. The effect of thickening the outer walls, shown in plan and section.

4. **COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS**: On your rough building plan, draw a dot to represent a column at the corner of every room and in the corners formed by lesser spaces like thick walls and alcoves. Then transfer these dots onto the ground out on the site with stakes.

5. **FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION**: ## Problem

How should the spacing of the secondary columns which stiffen the walls, vary with ceiling height, number of stories and the size of rooms?


## Relationship to Construction Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Structural systems, materials, construction methods, and architectural details

**Purpose**: These patterns specify the physical construction and material details that bring buildings to life, ensuring structural integrity while creating beauty and human comfort.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Construction patterns complete the pattern language by providing the detailed specifications needed to actually build the spaces envisioned in Towns and Buildings patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence works at the Structural system to detail scale (Patterns 205-253) level within the Construction category. It establishes the structural framework and primary building systems.

The sequence includes 5 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Construction sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 2 of 8 sequences in Construction category
- **Scope**: Foundational patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Construction sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence realizes the intentions established by Towns and Buildings patterns:
- Translates spatial concepts into physical structure
- Specifies materials and construction methods
- Creates the tactile and visual details that inhabitants experience

These patterns complete the pattern language by making abstract spatial ideas into concrete reality.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Construction category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During construction documentation and detailing
- When specifying materials and methods
- After spatial organization is established

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
