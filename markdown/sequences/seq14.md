## Overview

Sequence 14 focuses on transformation of work and learning

## Emergent Phenomena

Learning and work environments that are integrated into community life

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 11 patterns:

1. **Pattern 79: YOUR OWN HOME**
   - Addresses: People cannot be genuinely comfortable and healthy in a house which is not theirs. All forms of rental - whether from private landlords or public housing agencies - work against the natural processes ...

2. **Pattern 80: SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES**
   - Addresses: No one enjoys his work if he is a cog in a machine.

3. **Pattern 81: SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

4. **Pattern 82: OFFICE CONNECTIONS**
   - Addresses: If two parts of an office are too far apart, people will not move between them as often as they need to; and if they are more than one floor apart, there will be almost no communication between the tw...

5. **Pattern 83: MASTER AND APRENTICES**
   - Addresses: The fundamental learning situation is one in which a person learns by helping someone who really knows what he is doing.

6. **Pattern 84: TEENAGE SOCIETY**
   - Addresses: Teenage is the time of passage between childhood and adulthood. In traditional societies, this passage is accompanied by rites which suit the psychological demands of the transition. But in modern soc...

7. **Pattern 85: SHOPFRONT SCHOOLS**
   - Addresses: Around the age of 6 or 7, children develop a great need to learn by doing, to make their mark on a community outside the home. If the setting is right, these needs lead children directly to basic skil...

8. **Pattern 86: CHILDREN'S HOME**
   - Addresses: The task of looking - after little children is a much deeper and more fundamental social issue than the phrases "babysitting" and "child care" suggest.

9. **Pattern 87: INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS**
   - Addresses: When shops are too large, or controlled by absentee owners, they become plastic, bland, and abstract.

10. **Pattern 88: STREET CAFE**
   - Addresses: The street cafe provides a unique setting, special to cities: a place where people can sit lazily, legitimately, be on view, and watch the world go by.

11. **Pattern 89: CORNER GROCERY**
   - Addresses: It has lately been assumed that people no longer want to walk to local stores. This assumption is mistaken.


The sequence flows from your own home to corner grocery, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **YOUR OWN HOME**: People cannot be genuinely comfortable and healthy in a house which is not theirs. All forms of rental - whether from private landlords or public housing agencies - work against the natural processes which allow people to form stable, self-healing communities.

2. **SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES**: No one enjoys his work if he is a cog in a machine.

3. **SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

4. **OFFICE CONNECTIONS**: If two parts of an office are too far apart, people will not move between them as often as they need to; and if they are more than one floor apart, there will be almost no communication between the two.

5. **MASTER AND APRENTICES**: The fundamental learning situation is one in which a person learns by helping someone who really knows what he is doing.

6. **TEENAGE SOCIETY**: Teenage is the time of passage between childhood and adulthood. In traditional societies, this passage is accompanied by rites which suit the psychological demands of the transition. But in modern society the "high school" fails entirely to provide this passage.

7. **SHOPFRONT SCHOOLS**: Around the age of 6 or 7, children develop a great need to learn by doing, to make their mark on a community outside the home. If the setting is right, these needs lead children directly to basic skills and habits of learning.

8. **CHILDREN'S HOME**: The task of looking - after little children is a much deeper and more fundamental social issue than the phrases "babysitting" and "child care" suggest.

9. **INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS**: When shops are too large, or controlled by absentee owners, they become plastic, bland, and abstract.

10. **STREET CAFE**: The street cafe provides a unique setting, special to cities: a place where people can sit lazily, legitimately, be on view, and watch the world go by.

11. **CORNER GROCERY**: It has lately been assumed that people no longer want to walk to local stores. This assumption is mistaken.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **YOUR OWN HOME**: Do everything possible to make the traditional forms of rental impossible, indeed, illegal. Give every household its own home, with space enough for a garden. Keep the emphasis in the definition of ownership on control, not on financial ownership. Indeed, where it is possible to construct forms of ownership which give people control over their houses and gardens, but make financial speculation impossible, choose these forms above all others. In all cases give people the legal power, and the physical opportunity to modify and repair their own places. Pay attention to this rule especially, in the case of high density apartments: build the apartments in such a way that every individual apartment has a garden, or a terrace where vegetables will grow, and that even in this situation, each family can build, and change, and add on to their house as they wish.

2. **SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES**: Encourage the formation of self-governing workshops and offices of 5 to 20 workers. Make each group autonomous - with respect to organization, style, relation to other groups, hiring and firing, work schedule. Where the work is complicated and requires larger organizations, several of these work groups can federate and cooperate to produce complex artifacts and services.

3. **SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE**: ## Problem

Departments and public services don't work if they are too large. When they are large, their human qualities vanish; they become bureaucratic; red tape takes over.

4. **OFFICE CONNECTIONS**: To establish distances between departments, calculate the number of trips per day made between each two departments; get the "nuisance distance" from the graph above; then make sure that the physical distance between the two departments is less than the nuisance distance. Reckon one flight of stairs as about 100 feet, and two flights of stairs as about 300 feet.

5. **MASTER AND APRENTICES**: Arrange the work in every workgroup, industry, and office, in such a way that work and learning go forward hand in hand. Treat every piece of work as an opportunity for learning. To this end, organize work around a tradition of masters and apprentices: and support this form of social organization with a division of the workspace into spatial clusters - one for each master and his apprenticeswhere they can work and meet together.

6. **TEENAGE SOCIETY**: Replace the "high school" with an institution which is actually a model of adult society, in which the students take on most of the responsibility for learning and social life, with clearly defined roles and forms of discipline. Provide adult guidance, both for the learning, and the social structure of the society; but keep them as far as feasible, in the hands of the students.

7. **SHOPFRONT SCHOOLS**: Instead of building large public schools for children 7 to 12, set up tiny independent schools, one school at a time. Keep the school small, so that its overheads are low and a teacher-student ratio of 1:10 can be maintained. Locate it in the public part of the community, with a shopfront and three or four rooms.

8. **CHILDREN'S HOME**: In every neighborhood, build a children's home - a second home for children - a large rambling house or workplace - a place where children can stay for an hour or two, or for a week. At least one of the people who run it must live on the premises; it must be open 24 hours a day; open to children of all ages; and it must be clear, from the way that it is run, that it is a second family for the children - not just a place where baby-sitting is available.

9. **INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS**: Do what you can to encourage the development of individually owned shops. Approve applications for business licenses only if the business is owned by those people who actually work and manage the store. Approve new commercial building permits only if the proposed structure includes many very very small rental spaces.

10. **STREET CAFE**: Encourage local cafes to spring up in each neighborhood. Make them intimate places, with several rooms, open to a busy path, where people can sit with coffee or a drink and watch the world go by. Build the front of the cafe so that a set of tables stretch out of the cafe, right into the street.

11. **CORNER GROCERY**: Give every neighborhood at least one corner grocery, somewhere near its heart. Place these corner groceries every 200 to 8oo yards, according to the density, so that each one serves about 1000 people. Place them on corners, where large numbers of people are going past. And combine them with houses, so that the people who run them can live over them or next to them.


## Relationship to Towns Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Large-scale urban planning, regional development, community structure, and public spaces

**Purpose**: These patterns establish the fundamental structure of human settlements from regions down to neighborhoods, ensuring balanced distribution of population, preservation of natural systems, and creation of identifiable communities.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Towns patterns form the foundation of the pattern language, creating the overall framework within which buildings and construction details must fit.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence contributes to the Towns category by establishing patterns at the Regional to neighborhood scale (Patterns 1-94) level. As a later sequence in this category, it addresses the transformation and refinement of community institutions.

The sequence includes 11 patterns, representing a comprehensive design process within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Towns sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 14 of 15 sequences in Towns category
- **Scope**: Refinement patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Towns sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence establishes constraints and context for Buildings patterns:
- Sets spatial boundaries and site conditions
- Defines community context and social requirements
- Establishes circulation and access frameworks

The patterns in this sequence must be considered before detailed building design begins, as they establish the essential context within which buildings will exist.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Towns category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During regional planning and urban development
- When establishing community structure and character
- At the beginning of large-scale design processes

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
