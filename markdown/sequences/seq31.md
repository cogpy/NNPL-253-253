## Overview

Sequence 31 focuses on mark the column locations and erect the main frame

## Emergent Phenomena

Primary structural framework that can support the intended building form and loads

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 7 patterns:

1. **Pattern 214: ROOT FOUNDATIONS**
   - Addresses: The best foundations of all are the kinds of foundations which a tree has - where the entire structure of the tree simply continues below ground level, and creates a system entirely integral with the ...

2. **Pattern 215: GROUND FLOOR SLAB**
   - Addresses: The slab is the easiest, cheapest, and most natural way to lay a ground floor.

3. **Pattern 216: BOX COLUMNS**
   - Addresses: In all the world's traditional and historic buildings, the columns are expressive, beautiful, and treasured elements. Only in modern buildings have they become ugly and meaningless.

4. **Pattern 217: PERIMETER BEAMS**
   - Addresses: If you conceive and build a room by first placing columns at the corners, and then gradually weaving the walls and ceiling round them, the room needs a perimeter beam around its upper edge.

5. **Pattern 218: WALL MEMBRANE**
   - Addresses: In organic construction the walls must take their share of the loads. They must work continuously with the structure on all four of their sides; and act to resist shear and bending, and take loads in ...

6. **Pattern 219: FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS**
   - Addresses: We seek a ceiling vault shape which will support a live load on the floor above, form the ceiling of the room below, and generate as little bending and tension as possible so that compressive material...

7. **Pattern 220: ROOF VAULTS**
   - Addresses: What is the best shape for a roof?


The sequence flows from root foundations to roof vaults, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **ROOT FOUNDATIONS**: The best foundations of all are the kinds of foundations which a tree has - where the entire structure of the tree simply continues below ground level, and creates a system entirely integral with the ground, in tension and compression.

2. **GROUND FLOOR SLAB**: The slab is the easiest, cheapest, and most natural way to lay a ground floor.

3. **BOX COLUMNS**: In all the world's traditional and historic buildings, the columns are expressive, beautiful, and treasured elements. Only in modern buildings have they become ugly and meaningless.

4. **PERIMETER BEAMS**: If you conceive and build a room by first placing columns at the corners, and then gradually weaving the walls and ceiling round them, the room needs a perimeter beam around its upper edge.

5. **WALL MEMBRANE**: In organic construction the walls must take their share of the loads. They must work continuously with the structure on all four of their sides; and act to resist shear and bending, and take loads in compression.

6. **FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS**: We seek a ceiling vault shape which will support a live load on the floor above, form the ceiling of the room below, and generate as little bending and tension as possible so that compressive materials can be relied on.

7. **ROOF VAULTS**: What is the best shape for a roof?

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **ROOT FOUNDATIONS**: Try to find a way of making foundations in which the columns themselves go right into the earth, and spread out there - so that the footing is continuous with the material of the column, and the column, with its footing, like a tree root, can resist tension and horizontal shear as well as compression.

2. **GROUND FLOOR SLAB**: Build a ground floor slab, raised slightly - six or nine inches above the ground - by first building a low perimeter wall around the building, tied into the column foundations, and then filling it with rubble, gravel, and concrete.

3. **BOX COLUMNS**: Make the columns in the form of filled hollow tubes, with a stiff tubular outer skin, and a solid core that is strong in compression. Give the skin of the column some tensile strength - preferably in the skin itself, but perhaps with reinforcing wires in the fill.

4. **PERIMETER BEAMS**: Build a continuous perimeter beam around the room, strong enough to resist the horizontal thrust of the vault above, to spread the loads from upper stories onto columns, to tie the columns together, and to function as a lintel over openings in the wall. Make this beam continuous with columns, walls and floor above, and columns and walls below.

5. **WALL MEMBRANE**: Build the wall as a membrane which connects the columns and door frames and windows frames and is, at least in part, continuous with them. To build the wall, first put up an inner and an outer membrane, which can function as a finished surface; then pour the fill into the wall.

6. **FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS**: Build floors and ceilings in the form of elliptical vaults which rise between 13 and 20 per cent of the shorter span. Use a type of construction which makes it possible to fit the vault to any shaped room after the walls and columns are in position: on no account use a prefabricated vault.

7. **ROOF VAULTS**: Build the roof vault either as a cylindrical barrel vault, or like a pitched roof with a slight convex curve in each of the two sloping sides. Put in undulations along the vault, to make the shell more effective. The curvature of the main shell, and of the undulations, can vary with the span; the bigger the span, the deeper the curvature and undulations need to be.


## Relationship to Construction Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Structural systems, materials, construction methods, and architectural details

**Purpose**: These patterns specify the physical construction and material details that bring buildings to life, ensuring structural integrity while creating beauty and human comfort.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Construction patterns complete the pattern language by providing the detailed specifications needed to actually build the spaces envisioned in Towns and Buildings patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence works at the Structural system to detail scale (Patterns 205-253) level within the Construction category. It establishes the structural framework and primary building systems.

The sequence includes 7 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Construction sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 3 of 8 sequences in Construction category
- **Scope**: Developmental patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Construction sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence realizes the intentions established by Towns and Buildings patterns:
- Translates spatial concepts into physical structure
- Specifies materials and construction methods
- Creates the tactile and visual details that inhabitants experience

These patterns complete the pattern language by making abstract spatial ideas into concrete reality.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Construction category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During construction documentation and detailing
- When specifying materials and methods
- After spatial organization is established

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
