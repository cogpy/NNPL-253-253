## Overview

Sequence 35 focuses on build outdoor details

## Emergent Phenomena

Exterior details that connect the building to its immediate surroundings

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 8 patterns:

1. **Pattern 241: SEAT SPOTS**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

2. **Pattern 242: FRONT DOOR BENCH**
   - Addresses: People like to watch the street.

3. **Pattern 243: SITTING WALL**
   - Addresses: In many places walls and fences between outdoor spaces are too high; but no boundary at all does injustice to the subtlety of the divisions between the spaces.

4. **Pattern 244: CANVAS ROOFS**
   - Addresses: There is a very special beauty about tents and canvas awnings. The canvas has a softness, a suppleness, which is in harmony with wind and light and sun. A house or any building built with some canvas ...

5. **Pattern 245: RAISED FLOWERS**
   - Addresses: Flowers are beautiful along the edges of paths, buildings, outdoor rooms - but it is just in these places that they need the most protection from traffic. Without some protection they cannot easily su...

6. **Pattern 246: CLIMBING PLANTS**
   - Addresses: A building finally becomes a part of its surroundings when the plants grow over parts of it as freely as they grow along the ground.

7. **Pattern 247: PAVING WITH CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES**
   - Addresses: Asphalt and concrete surfaces outdoors are easy to wash down, but they do nothing for us, nothing for the paths, and nothing for the rainwater and plants.

8. **Pattern 248: SOFT TILE AND BRICK**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.


The sequence flows from seat spots to soft tile and brick, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **SEAT SPOTS**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

2. **FRONT DOOR BENCH**: People like to watch the street.

3. **SITTING WALL**: In many places walls and fences between outdoor spaces are too high; but no boundary at all does injustice to the subtlety of the divisions between the spaces.

4. **CANVAS ROOFS**: There is a very special beauty about tents and canvas awnings. The canvas has a softness, a suppleness, which is in harmony with wind and light and sun. A house or any building built with some canvas will touch all the elements more nearly than it can when it is made only with hard conventional materials.

5. **RAISED FLOWERS**: Flowers are beautiful along the edges of paths, buildings, outdoor rooms - but it is just in these places that they need the most protection from traffic. Without some protection they cannot easily survive.

6. **CLIMBING PLANTS**: A building finally becomes a part of its surroundings when the plants grow over parts of it as freely as they grow along the ground.

7. **PAVING WITH CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES**: Asphalt and concrete surfaces outdoors are easy to wash down, but they do nothing for us, nothing for the paths, and nothing for the rainwater and plants.

8. **SOFT TILE AND BRICK**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **SEAT SPOTS**: ## Problem

Where outdoor seats are set down without regard for view and climate, they will almost certainly be useless.

2. **FRONT DOOR BENCH**: Build a special bench outside the front door where people from inside can sit comfortably for hours on end and watch the world go by. Place the bench to define a half-private domain in front of the house. A low wall, planting, a tree, can help to create the same domain.

3. **SITTING WALL**: Surround any natural outdoor area, and make minor boundaries between outdoor areas with low walls, about 16 inches high, and wide enough to sit on, at least 12 inches wide.

4. **CANVAS ROOFS**: Build canvas roofs and walls and awnings wherever there are spaces which need softer light or partial shade in summer, or partial protection from mist and dew in autumn and winter. Build them to fold away, with ropes or wires to pull them, so that they can easily be opened.

5. **RAISED FLOWERS**: Soften the edges of buildings, paths, and outdoor areas with flowers. Raise the flower beds so that people can touch the flowers, bend to smell them, and sit by them. And build the flower beds with solid edges, so that people can sit on them, among the flowers too.

6. **CLIMBING PLANTS**: On sunny walls, train climbing plants to grow up round the openings in the wall-the windows, doors, porches, arcades, and trellises.

7. **PAVING WITH CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES**: On paths and terraces, lay paving stones with a 1 inch crack between the stones, so that grass and mosses and small flowers can grow between the stones. Lay the stones directly into earth, not into mortar, and, of course, use no cement or mortar in between the stones.

8. **SOFT TILE AND BRICK**: ## Problem

How can a person feel the earth, or time, or any connection with his surroundings, when he is walking on the hard mechanical wash-easy surfaces of concrete, asphalt, hard-fired architectural paving bricks, or artificially concocted mixes like terrazo.


## Relationship to Construction Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Structural systems, materials, construction methods, and architectural details

**Purpose**: These patterns specify the physical construction and material details that bring buildings to life, ensuring structural integrity while creating beauty and human comfort.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Construction patterns complete the pattern language by providing the detailed specifications needed to actually build the spaces envisioned in Towns and Buildings patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence works at the Structural system to detail scale (Patterns 205-253) level within the Construction category. It specifies the detailed elements and finishes that complete the construction.

The sequence includes 8 patterns, representing a comprehensive design process within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Construction sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 7 of 8 sequences in Construction category
- **Scope**: Refinement patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Construction sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence realizes the intentions established by Towns and Buildings patterns:
- Translates spatial concepts into physical structure
- Specifies materials and construction methods
- Creates the tactile and visual details that inhabitants experience

These patterns complete the pattern language by making abstract spatial ideas into concrete reality.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Construction category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During construction documentation and detailing
- When specifying materials and methods
- After spatial organization is established

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
