## Overview

Sequence 16 focuses on the overall arrangement of a group of buildings

## Emergent Phenomena

Building groups that create coherent outdoor spaces and support community interaction

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 9 patterns:

1. **Pattern 95: BUILDING COMPLEX**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

2. **Pattern 96: NUMBER OF STORIES**
   - Addresses: Within the four-story height limit, just exactly how high should your buildings be?

3. **Pattern 97: SHIELDED PARKING**
   - Addresses: Large parking structures full of cars are inhuman and dead buildings - no one wants to see them or walk by them. At the same time, if you are driving, the entrance to a parking structure is essentiall...

4. **Pattern 98: CIRCULATION REALMS**
   - Addresses: In many modern building complexes the problem of disorientation is acute. People have no idea where they are, and they experience considerable mental stress as a result.

5. **Pattern 99: MAIN BUILDING**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

6. **Pattern 100: PEDESTRIAN STREET**
   - Addresses: The simple social intercourse created when people rub shoulders in public is one of the most essential kinds of social "glue" in society.

7. **Pattern 101: BUILDING THOROUGHFARE**
   - Addresses: When a public building complex cannot be completely served by outdoor pedestrian streets, a new form of indoor street, quite different from the conventional corridor, is needed.

8. **Pattern 102: FAMILY OF ENTRANCES**
   - Addresses: When a person arrives in a complex of offices, or services or workshops, or in a group of related houses, there is a good chance he will experience confusion unless the whole collection is laid out be...

9. **Pattern 103: SMALL PARKING LOTS**
   - Addresses: Vast parking lots wreck the land for people.


The sequence flows from building complex to small parking lots, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **BUILDING COMPLEX**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

2. **NUMBER OF STORIES**: Within the four-story height limit, just exactly how high should your buildings be?

3. **SHIELDED PARKING**: Large parking structures full of cars are inhuman and dead buildings - no one wants to see them or walk by them. At the same time, if you are driving, the entrance to a parking structure is essentially the main entrance to the building - and it needs to be visible.

4. **CIRCULATION REALMS**: In many modern building complexes the problem of disorientation is acute. People have no idea where they are, and they experience considerable mental stress as a result.

5. **MAIN BUILDING**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

6. **PEDESTRIAN STREET**: The simple social intercourse created when people rub shoulders in public is one of the most essential kinds of social "glue" in society.

7. **BUILDING THOROUGHFARE**: When a public building complex cannot be completely served by outdoor pedestrian streets, a new form of indoor street, quite different from the conventional corridor, is needed.

8. **FAMILY OF ENTRANCES**: When a person arrives in a complex of offices, or services or workshops, or in a group of related houses, there is a good chance he will experience confusion unless the whole collection is laid out before him, so that he can see the entrance of the place where he is going.

9. **SMALL PARKING LOTS**: Vast parking lots wreck the land for people.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **BUILDING COMPLEX**: ## Problem

A building cannot be a human building unless it is a complex of still smaller buildings or smaller parts which manifest its own internal social facts.

2. **NUMBER OF STORIES**: First, decide how many square feet of built space you need, and divide by the area of the site to get the floor area ratio. Then choose the height of your buildings according to the floor area ratio and the height of the surrounding buildings from the following table. In no case build on more than 50 per cent of the land.

3. **SHIELDED PARKING**: Put all large parking lots, or parking garages, behind some kind of natural wall, so that the cars and parking structures cannot be seen from outside. The wall which surrounds the cars may be a building, connected houses, or housing hills, earth berms, or shops. Make the entrance to the parking lot a natural gateway to the buildings which it serves, and place it so that you can easily see the main entrance to the building from the entrance to the parking.

4. **CIRCULATION REALMS**: Lay out very large buildings and collections of small buildings so that one reaches a given point inside by passing through a sequence of realms, each marked by a gateway and becoming smaller and smaller, as one passes from each one, through a gateway, to the next. Choose the realms so that each one can be easily named, so that you can tell a person where to go, simply by telling him which realms to go through.

5. **MAIN BUILDING**: ## Problem

A complex of buildings with no center is like a man without a head.

6. **PEDESTRIAN STREET**: Arrange buildings so that they form pedestrian streets with many entrances and open stairs directly from the upper storys to the street, so that even movement between rooms is outdoors, not just movement between buildings.

7. **BUILDING THOROUGHFARE**: Wherever density or climate force the main lines of circulation indoors, build them as building thoroughfares. Place each thoroughfare in a position where it functions as a shortcut, as continuous as possible with the public street outside, with wide open entrances. And line its edges with windows, places to sit, counters, and entrances which project out into the hall and expose the buildings' main functions to the public. Make it wider than a normal corridor - at least 11 feet wide and more usually, 15 to 20 feet wide; give it a high ceiling, at least 15 feet, with a glazed roof if possible and low places along the edge. If the street is several stories high, then the walkways along the edges, on the different stories, can be used to form the low places.

8. **FAMILY OF ENTRANCES**: Lay out the entrances to form a family. This means:

9. **SMALL PARKING LOTS**: Make parking lots small, serving no more than five to seven cars, each lot surrounded by garden walls, hedges, fences, slopes, and trees, so that from outside the cars are almost invisible. Space these small lots so that they are at least 100 feet apart.


## Relationship to Buildings Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Building arrangement, spatial organization, room configuration, and indoor-outdoor transitions

**Purpose**: These patterns guide the design of individual buildings and building groups, creating spaces that support human activities, facilitate social interaction, and connect meaningfully with their surroundings.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Buildings patterns bridge between the large-scale structure established by Towns patterns and the detailed construction specified by Construction patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence operates at the Building complex to room scale (Patterns 95-204) level within the Buildings category. It focuses on the arrangement and positioning of buildings and their outdoor spaces.

The sequence includes 9 patterns, representing a comprehensive design process within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Buildings sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 1 of 13 sequences in Buildings category
- **Scope**: Foundational patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Buildings sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence bridges between Towns and Construction:
- **From Towns**: Inherits site conditions, community context, and spatial constraints
- **To Construction**: Provides spatial requirements, structural implications, and material needs

The patterns operate at the critical middle scale where urban context meets physical construction.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Buildings category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During building design and site planning
- When organizing spaces and circulation
- After Towns patterns establish context

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
