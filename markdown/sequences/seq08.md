## Metadata

- **Pattern Count**: 6

## Overview

Sequence 8 focuses on housing

## Emergent Phenomena

Diverse housing that accommodates different household types and life stages

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 6 patterns:

1. **Pattern 35: HOUSEHOLD MIX**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

2. **Pattern 36: DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS**
   - Addresses: People are different, and the way they want to place their houses in a neighborhood is one of the most basic kinds of difference.

3. **Pattern 37: HOUSE CLUSTER**
   - Addresses: People will not feel comfortable in their houses unless a group of houses forms a cluster, with the public land between them jointly owned by all the householders.

4. **Pattern 38: ROW HOUSES**
   - Addresses: At densities of 15 to 30 houses per acre, row houses are essential. But typical row houses are dark inside, and stamped from an identical mould.

5. **Pattern 39: HOUSING HILL**
   - Addresses: Every town has places in it which are so central and desirable that at least 30-50 households per acre will be living there. But the apartment houses which reach this density are almost all impersonal...

6. **Pattern 40: OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.


The sequence flows from household mix to old people everywhere, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **HOUSEHOLD MIX**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

2. **DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS**: People are different, and the way they want to place their houses in a neighborhood is one of the most basic kinds of difference.

3. **HOUSE CLUSTER**: People will not feel comfortable in their houses unless a group of houses forms a cluster, with the public land between them jointly owned by all the householders.

4. **ROW HOUSES**: At densities of 15 to 30 houses per acre, row houses are essential. But typical row houses are dark inside, and stamped from an identical mould.

5. **HOUSING HILL**: Every town has places in it which are so central and desirable that at least 30-50 households per acre will be living there. But the apartment houses which reach this density are almost all impersonal.

6. **OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **HOUSEHOLD MIX**: ## Problem

No one stage in the life cycle is self-sufficient.

2. **DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS**: Make a clear distinction between three kinds of homes - those on quiet backwaters, those on busy streets, and those that are more or less in between. Make sure that those on quiet backwaters are on twisting paths, and that these houses are themselves physically secluded; make sure that the more public houses are on busy streets with many people passing by all day long and that the houses themselves are relatively exposed to the passersby. The inbetween houses may then be located on the paths half-way between the other two. Give every neighborhood about equal numbers of these three kinds of homes.

3. **HOUSE CLUSTER**: Arrange houses to form very rough, but identifiable clusters of 8 to 12 households around some common land and paths. Arrange the clusters so that anyone can walk through them, without feeling like a trespasser.

4. **ROW HOUSES**: For row houses, place houses along pedestrian paths that run at right angles to local roads and parking lots, and give each house a long frontage and a shallow depth.

5. **HOUSING HILL**: To build more than 30 dwellings per net acre, or to build housing three or four stories high, build a hill of houses. Build them to form stepped terraces, sioping toward the south, served by a great central open stair which also faces south and leads toward a common garden . . .

6. **OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE**: ## Problem

Old people need old people, but they also need the young, and young people need contact with the old.


## Relationship to Towns Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Large-scale urban planning, regional development, community structure, and public spaces

**Purpose**: These patterns establish the fundamental structure of human settlements from regions down to neighborhoods, ensuring balanced distribution of population, preservation of natural systems, and creation of identifiable communities.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Towns patterns form the foundation of the pattern language, creating the overall framework within which buildings and construction details must fit.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence contributes to the Towns category by establishing patterns at the Regional to neighborhood scale (Patterns 1-94) level. As a mid-level sequence, it develops specific aspects of urban life and infrastructure.

The sequence includes 6 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Towns sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 8 of 15 sequences in Towns category
- **Scope**: Developmental patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Towns sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence establishes constraints and context for Buildings patterns:
- Sets spatial boundaries and site conditions
- Defines community context and social requirements
- Establishes circulation and access frameworks

The patterns in this sequence must be considered before detailed building design begins, as they establish the essential context within which buildings will exist.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Towns category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During regional planning and urban development
- When establishing community structure and character
- At the beginning of large-scale design processes

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
