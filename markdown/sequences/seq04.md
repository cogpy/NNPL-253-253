# Sequence 4: Communities and neighborhoods

## Metadata

- **Category**: Towns
- **Scale**: Regional to neighborhood scale (Patterns 1-94)
- **Patterns**: 12, 13, 14, 15
- **Pattern Count**: 4

## Overview

Sequence 4 focuses on communities and neighborhoods

## Emergent Phenomena

Human-scale communities where people know each other and can participate in local governance

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 4 patterns:

1. **Pattern 12: COMMUNITY OF 7000**
   - Addresses: Individuals have no effective voice in any community of more than 5000-10,000 persons.

2. **Pattern 13: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY**
   - Addresses: The mosaic of subcultures requires that hundreds of different cultures live, in their own way, at full intensity, next door to one another. But subcultures have their own ecology. They can only live a...

3. **Pattern 14: IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD**
   - Addresses: People need an identifiable spatial unit to belong to.

4. **Pattern 15: NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY**
   - Addresses: The strength of the boundary is essential to a neighborhood. If the boundary is too weak the neighborhood will not be able to maintain its own identifiable character.


The sequence flows from community of 7000 to neighborhood boundary, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **COMMUNITY OF 7000**: Individuals have no effective voice in any community of more than 5000-10,000 persons.

2. **SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY**: The mosaic of subcultures requires that hundreds of different cultures live, in their own way, at full intensity, next door to one another. But subcultures have their own ecology. They can only live at full intensity, unhampered by their neighbors, if they are physically separated by physical boundaries.

3. **IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD**: People need an identifiable spatial unit to belong to.

4. **NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY**: The strength of the boundary is essential to a neighborhood. If the boundary is too weak the neighborhood will not be able to maintain its own identifiable character.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **COMMUNITY OF 7000**: Decentralize city governments in a way that gives local control to communities of 5,000 to 10,000 persons. As nearly as possible, use natural geographic and historical boundaries to mark these communites. Give each community the power to initiate, decide, and execute the affairs that concern it closely: land use, housing, maintenance, streets, parks, police, schooling, welfare, neighborhood services.

2. **SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY**: Separate neighboring subcultures with a swath of land at least 200 feet wide. Let this boundary be natural wilderness, farmland, water - or man-made - railroads, major roads, parks, schools, some housing. Along the seam between two subcultures, build meeting places, shared functions, touching each community.

3. **IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD**: Help people to define the neighborhoods they live in, not more than 300 yards across, with no more than 400 or 500 inhabitants. In existing cities, encourage local groups to organize themselves to form such neighborhoods. Give the neighborhoods some degree of autonomy as far as taxes and land controls are concerned. Keep major roads outside these neighborhoods.

4. **NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY**: Encourage the formation of a boundary around each neighborhood, to separate it from the next door neighborhoods. Form this boundary by closing down streets and limiting access to the neighborhood - cut the normal number of streets at least in half. Place gateways at those points where the restricted access paths cross the boundary; and make the boundary zone wide enough to contain meeting places for the common functions shared by several neighborhoods.


## Relationship to Towns Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Large-scale urban planning, regional development, community structure, and public spaces

**Purpose**: These patterns establish the fundamental structure of human settlements from regions down to neighborhoods, ensuring balanced distribution of population, preservation of natural systems, and creation of identifiable communities.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Towns patterns form the foundation of the pattern language, creating the overall framework within which buildings and construction details must fit.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence contributes to the Towns category by establishing patterns at the Regional to neighborhood scale (Patterns 1-94) level. As an early sequence in this category, it helps define the fundamental structure and organization of settlements.

The sequence includes 4 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Towns sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 4 of 15 sequences in Towns category
- **Scope**: Foundational patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Towns sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence establishes constraints and context for Buildings patterns:
- Sets spatial boundaries and site conditions
- Defines community context and social requirements
- Establishes circulation and access frameworks

The patterns in this sequence must be considered before detailed building design begins, as they establish the essential context within which buildings will exist.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Towns category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During regional planning and urban development
- When establishing community structure and character
- At the beginning of large-scale design processes

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
