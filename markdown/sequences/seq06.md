## Overview

Sequence 6 focuses on character of local environments

## Emergent Phenomena

Local environments that support human life and activity at the pedestrian scale

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 7 patterns:

1. **Pattern 21: FOUR-STORY LIMIT**
   - Addresses: There is abundant evidence to show that high buildings make people crazy.

2. **Pattern 22: NINE PER CENT PARKING**
   - Addresses: Very simplywhen the area devoted to parking is too great, it destroys the land.

3. **Pattern 23: PARALLEL ROADS**
   - Addresses: The net-like pattern of streets is obsolete. Congestion is choking cities. Cars can average 60 miles per hour on freeways, but trips across town have an average speed of only 10 to 15 miles per hour.

4. **Pattern 24: SACRED SITES**
   - Addresses: People cannot maintain their spiritual roots and their connections to the past if the physical world they live in does not also sustain these roots.

5. **Pattern 25: ACCESS TO WATER**
   - Addresses: People have a fundamental yearning for great bodies of water. But the very movement of the people toward the water can also destroy the water.

6. **Pattern 26: LIFE CYCLE**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

7. **Pattern 27: MEN AND WOMEN**
   - Addresses: The world of a town in the 1970's is split along sexual lines. Suburbs are for women, workplaces for men; kindergartens are for women, professional schools for men; supermarkets are for women, hardwar...


The sequence flows from four-story limit to men and women, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **FOUR-STORY LIMIT**: There is abundant evidence to show that high buildings make people crazy.

2. **NINE PER CENT PARKING**: Very simplywhen the area devoted to parking is too great, it destroys the land.

3. **PARALLEL ROADS**: The net-like pattern of streets is obsolete. Congestion is choking cities. Cars can average 60 miles per hour on freeways, but trips across town have an average speed of only 10 to 15 miles per hour.

4. **SACRED SITES**: People cannot maintain their spiritual roots and their connections to the past if the physical world they live in does not also sustain these roots.

5. **ACCESS TO WATER**: People have a fundamental yearning for great bodies of water. But the very movement of the people toward the water can also destroy the water.

6. **LIFE CYCLE**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

7. **MEN AND WOMEN**: The world of a town in the 1970's is split along sexual lines. Suburbs are for women, workplaces for men; kindergartens are for women, professional schools for men; supermarkets are for women, hardware stores for men.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **FOUR-STORY LIMIT**: In any urban area, no matter how dense, keep the majority of buildings four stories high or less. It is possible that certain buildings should exceed this limit, but they should never be buildings for human habitation.

2. **NINE PER CENT PARKING**: Do not allow more than 9 per cent of the land in any given area to be used for parking. In order to prevent the "bunching" of parking in huge neglected areas, it is necessary for a town or a community to subdivide its land into "parking zones" no larger than 10 acres each and to apply the same rule in each zone.

3. **PARALLEL ROADS**: Within a local transport area build no intersecting major roads at all; instead, build a system of parallel and alternating one-way roads to carry traffic to the RING ROADS (17). In existing towns, create this structure piecemeal, by gradually making major streets one-way and closing cross streets. Keep parallel roads at least 100 yards apart (to make room for neighborhoods between them) and no more than 300 or 400 yards apart.

4. **SACRED SITES**: Whether the sacred sites are large or small, whether they are at the center of the towns, in neighborhoods, or in the deepest countryside, establish ordinances which will protect them absolutely so that our roots in the visible surroundings cannot be violated.

5. **ACCESS TO WATER**: When natural bodies of water occur near human settlements, treat them with great respect. Always preserve a belt of common land, immediately beside the water. And allow dense settlements to come right down to the water only at infrequent intervals along the water's edge.

6. **LIFE CYCLE**: ## Discussion

To live life to the fullest, in each of the seven ages, each age must be clearly marked, by the community, as a distinct wellmarked time. And the ages will only seem clearly marked if the ceremonies which mark the passage from one age to the next are firmly marked by celebrations and distinctions. By contrast, in a flat suburban culture the seven ages are not at all clearly marked; they are not celebrated; the passages from one age to the next have almost been forgotten. Under these conditions, people distort themselves. They can neither fulfill themselves in any one age nor pass successfully on to the next. Like the sixty-year-old woman wearing bright red lipstick on her wrinkles, they cling ferociously to what they never fully had. This proposition hinges on two arguments. A. The cycle of life is a definite psychological reality. It consists of discrete stages, each one fraught with its own difficulties, each one with its own special advantages. B. Growth from one stage to another is not inevitable, and, in fact, it will not happen unless the community contains a balanced life cycle. I. The Reality of the Life Cycle. Everyone can recognize the fact that a person's life traverses several stages-infancy to old age. What is perhaps not so well understood is the idea that each stage is a discrete reality, with its own special compensations and difficulties; that each stage has certain characteristic experiences that go with it. The most inspired work along these lines has come from Erik Erikson: "Identity and the Life Cycle," in Psychological Issues, Vol. 1, No. 1, New York: International Universities Press) 959; and Childhood and Society, New York: W. W. Norton, 1950. Erikson describes the sequence of phases a person must pass through as he matures and suggests that each phase is characterized by a specific developmental task - a successful resolution of some life conflict-and that this task must be solved by a person before he can move wholeheartedly forward to the next phase. Here is a summary of the stages in Erikson's scheme, adapted from his charts: 1. Trust vs. mistrust:the infant; relationship between the infant and mother; the struggle for confidence that the environment will nourish. 2. Autonomy vs. shame and doubt:the very young child; relationship between the child and parents; the struggle to stand on one's own two feet, to find autonomy in the face of experiences of shame and doubt as to one's capacity for self-control. 3. Initiative vs. guilt:the child; relationship to the family, the ring of friends; the search for action, and the integrity of one's acts; to make and eagerly learn, checked by the fear and guilt of one's own aggressions. 4. Industry vs. inferiority:the youngster; relationship to the neighborhood, the school; adaptation to the society's tools; the sense that one can make things well, alone, and with others, against the experience of failure, inadequacy. 5. Identity vs. identity diffusion:youth, adolescence; relationship to peers and "outgroups" and the search for models of adult life; the search for continuity in one's own character against confusion and doubt; a moratorium; a time to find and ally oneself with creeds and programs of the world. 6. Intimacy vs. isolation:young adults; partners in friendship, sex, work; the struggle to commit oneself concretely in relations with others; to lose and find oneself in another, against isolation and the avoidance of others. 7. Generativity vs. stagnation:adults; the relationship between a person and the division of labor, and the creation of a shared household; the struggle to establish and guide, to create, against the failure to do so, and the feelings of stagnation. 8. Integrity vs. despair:old age; the relationship between a person and his world, his kind, mankind; the achievement of wisdom; love for oneself and one's kind; to face death openly, with the forces of one's life integrated; vs. the despair that life has been useless. B. But growth through the life cycle is not inevitable. It depends on the presence of a balanced community, a community that can sustain the give and take of growth. Persons at each stage of life have something irreplaceable to give and to take from the community, and it is just these transactions which help a person to solve the problems that beset each stage. Consider the case of a young couple and their new child. The connection between them is entirely mutual. Of course, the child "depends" on the parents to give the care and love that is required to resolve the conflict of trust, that goes with infancy. But simultaneously, the child gives the parents the experience of raising and bearing, which helps them to meet their conflict of generativity, unique to adulthood. We distort the situation if we abstract it in such a way that we consider the parent as "having" such and such a personality when the child is born and then, remaining static, impinging upon a poor little thing. For this weak and changing little being moves the whole family along. Babies control and bring up their families as much as they are controlled by them; in fact, we may say that the family brings up a baby by being brought up by him. Whatever reaction patterns are given biologically and whatever schedule is predetermined developmentally must be considered to be a series of potentialities for changing patterns of mutual regulation. [Erikson, ibid. p. 69.1 Similar patterns of mutual regulation occur between the very old and the very young; between adolescents and young adults, children and infants, teenagers and younger teenagers, young men and old women, young women and old men, and so on. And these patterns must be made viable by prevailing social institutions and those parts of the environment which help to maintain them - the schools, nurseries, homes, cafes, bedrooms, sports fields, workshops, studios, gardens, graveyards. . . . We believe, however, that the balance of settings which allow normal growth through the life cycle has been breaking down. Contact with the entire cycle of life is less and less available to each person, at each moment in time. In place of natural communities with a balanced life cycle we have retirement villages, bedrooms suburbs, teenage culture, ghettos of unemployed, college towns, mass cemeteries, industrial parks. Under such conditions, one's chances for solving the conflict that comes with each stage in the life cycle are slim indeed. To re-create a community of balanced life cycles requires, first of all, that the idea take its place as a principal guide in the development of communities. Each building project, whether the addition to a house, a new road, a clinic, can be viewed as either helping or hindering the right balance for local communities.We suspect that the community repair maps, discussed in The Oregon Experiment,Chapter V (Volume 3 in this series), can play an especially useful role in helping to encourage the growth of a balanced life cycle. But this pattern can be no more than an indication of work that needs to be done. Each community must find ways of taking stock of its own relative "balance" in this respect, and then define a growth process which will move it in the right direction. This is a tremendously interesting and vital problem; it needs a great deal of development, experiment, and theory. If Erikson is right, and if this kind of work does not come, it seems possible that the development of trust, autonomy, initiative, industry, identity, intimacy, generativity, integrity may disappear entirely. xSTAGE IMPORTANT SETTINGS RITES OF PASSAGE 1.

7. **MEN AND WOMEN**: Make certain that each piece of the environment - each building, open space, neighborhood, and work community - is made with a blend of both men's and women's instincts. Keep this balance of masculine and feminine in mind for every project at every scale, from the kitchen to the steel mill.


## Relationship to Towns Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Large-scale urban planning, regional development, community structure, and public spaces

**Purpose**: These patterns establish the fundamental structure of human settlements from regions down to neighborhoods, ensuring balanced distribution of population, preservation of natural systems, and creation of identifiable communities.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Towns patterns form the foundation of the pattern language, creating the overall framework within which buildings and construction details must fit.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence contributes to the Towns category by establishing patterns at the Regional to neighborhood scale (Patterns 1-94) level. As an early sequence in this category, it helps define the fundamental structure and organization of settlements.

The sequence includes 7 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.
