## Overview

Sequence 9 focuses on work

## Emergent Phenomena

Integration of work into the fabric of community life rather than segregated industrial zones

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 10 patterns:

1. **Pattern 41: WORK COMMUNITY**
   - Addresses: If you spend eight hours of your day at work, and eight hours at home, there is no reason why your workplace should be any less of a community than your home.

2. **Pattern 42: INDUSTRIAL RIBBON**
   - Addresses: Exaggerated zoning laws separate industry from the rest of urban life completely, and contribute to the plastic unreality of sheltered residential neighborhoods.

3. **Pattern 43: UNIVERSITY AS MARKETPLACE**
   - Addresses: Concentrated, cloistered universities, with closed admission policies and rigid procedures which dictate who may teach a course, kill opportunities for learning.

4. **Pattern 44: LOCAL TOWN HALL**
   - Addresses: Local government of communities and local control by the inhabitants, will only happen if each community has its own physical town hall which forms the nucleus of its political activity.

5. **Pattern 45: NECKLACE OF COMMUNITY PROJECTS**
   - Addresses: The local town hall will not be an honest part of the community which lives around it, unIess it is itself surrounded by all kinds of small community activities and projects, generated by the people f...

6. **Pattern 46: MARKET OF MANY SHOPS**
   - Addresses: It is natural and convenient to want a market where all the different foods and household goods you need can be bought under a single roof. But when the market has a single management, like a supermar...

7. **Pattern 47: HEALTH CENTER**
   - Addresses: More than 90 per cent of the people walking about in an ordinary neighborhood are unhealthy, judged by simple biological criteria. This ill health cannot be cured by hospitals or medicine.

8. **Pattern 48: HOUSING IN BETWEEN**
   - Addresses: Wherever there is a sharp separation between residential and nonresidential parts of town, the nonresidential areas will quickly turn to slums.

9. **Pattern 49: LOOPED LOCAL ROADS**
   - Addresses: Nobody wants fast through traffic going by their homes.

10. **Pattern 50: T JUNCTIONS**
   - Addresses: Traffic accidents are far more frequent where two roads cross than at T junctions.


The sequence flows from work community to t junctions, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **WORK COMMUNITY**: If you spend eight hours of your day at work, and eight hours at home, there is no reason why your workplace should be any less of a community than your home.

2. **INDUSTRIAL RIBBON**: Exaggerated zoning laws separate industry from the rest of urban life completely, and contribute to the plastic unreality of sheltered residential neighborhoods.

3. **UNIVERSITY AS MARKETPLACE**: Concentrated, cloistered universities, with closed admission policies and rigid procedures which dictate who may teach a course, kill opportunities for learning.

4. **LOCAL TOWN HALL**: Local government of communities and local control by the inhabitants, will only happen if each community has its own physical town hall which forms the nucleus of its political activity.

5. **NECKLACE OF COMMUNITY PROJECTS**: The local town hall will not be an honest part of the community which lives around it, unIess it is itself surrounded by all kinds of small community activities and projects, generated by the people for themselves.

6. **MARKET OF MANY SHOPS**: It is natural and convenient to want a market where all the different foods and household goods you need can be bought under a single roof. But when the market has a single management, like a supermarket, the foods are bland, and there is no joy in going there.

7. **HEALTH CENTER**: More than 90 per cent of the people walking about in an ordinary neighborhood are unhealthy, judged by simple biological criteria. This ill health cannot be cured by hospitals or medicine.

8. **HOUSING IN BETWEEN**: Wherever there is a sharp separation between residential and nonresidential parts of town, the nonresidential areas will quickly turn to slums.

9. **LOOPED LOCAL ROADS**: Nobody wants fast through traffic going by their homes.

10. **T JUNCTIONS**: Traffic accidents are far more frequent where two roads cross than at T junctions.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **WORK COMMUNITY**: Build or encourage the formation of work communities - each one a collection of smaller clusters of workplaces which have their own courtyards, gathered round a larger common square or common courtyard which contains shops and lunch counters. The total work community should have no more than 10 or 20 workplaces in it.

2. **INDUSTRIAL RIBBON**: Place industry in ribbons, between 200 and 500 feet wide, which form the boundaries between communities. Break these ribbons into long blocks, varying in area between 1 and 25 acres; and treat the edge of every ribbon as a place where people from nearby communities can benefit from the offshoots of the industrial activity.

3. **UNIVERSITY AS MARKETPLACE**: Establish the university as a marketplace of higher education. As a social conception this means that the university is open to people of all ages, on a full-time, part-time, or course by course basis. Anyone can offer a class. Anyone can take a class. Physically, the university marketplace has a central crossroads where its main buildings and offices are, and the meeting rooms and labs ripple out from this crossroads - at first concentrated in small buildings along pedestrian streets and then gradually becoming more dispersed and mixed with the town.

4. **LOCAL TOWN HALL**: To make the political control of local functions real, establish a small town hall for each community of 7000, and even for each neighborhood; locate it near the busiest intersection in the community. Give the building three parts: an arena for public discussion, public services around the arena, and space to rent out to ad hoc community projects.

5. **NECKLACE OF COMMUNITY PROJECTS**: Allow the growth of shop-size spaces around the local town hall, and any other appropriate community building. Front these shops on a busy path, and lease them for a minimum rent to ad hoc community groups for political work, trial services, research, and advocate groups. No ideological restrictions.

6. **MARKET OF MANY SHOPS**: Instead of modern supermarkets, establish frequent marketplaces, each one made up of many smaller shops which are autonomous and specialized (cheese, meat, grain, fruit, and so on). Build the structure of the market as a minimum, which provides no more than a roof, columns which define aisles, and basic services. Within this structure allow the different shops to create their own environment, according to their individual taste and needs.

7. **HEALTH CENTER**: Gradually develop a network of small health centers, perhaps one per community of 7000, across the city; each equippect to treat everyday disease both mental and physical, in children and adults - but organized essentially around a functional emphasis on those recreational and educational activities which help keep people in good health, like swimming anc dancmg.

8. **HOUSING IN BETWEEN**: Build houses into the fabric of shops, small industry, schools, public services, universities all those parts of cities which draw people in during the day, but which tend to be "nonresidential." The houses may be in rows or "hills" with shops beneath, or they may be free-standing, so long as they mix with the other functions, and make the entire area "lived-in."

9. **LOOPED LOCAL ROADS**: Lay out local roads so that they form loops. A loop is defined as any stretch of road which makes it impossible for cars that don't have destinations on it to use it as a shortcut. Do not allow any one loop to serve more than 50 cars, and keep the road really narrow - 17 to 20 feet is quite enough.

10. **T JUNCTIONS**: Lay out the road system so that any two roads which meet at grade, meet in three-way T junctions as near 90 degrees as possible. Avoid four-way intersections and crossing movements.


## Relationship to Towns Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Large-scale urban planning, regional development, community structure, and public spaces

**Purpose**: These patterns establish the fundamental structure of human settlements from regions down to neighborhoods, ensuring balanced distribution of population, preservation of natural systems, and creation of identifiable communities.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Towns patterns form the foundation of the pattern language, creating the overall framework within which buildings and construction details must fit.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence contributes to the Towns category by establishing patterns at the Regional to neighborhood scale (Patterns 1-94) level. As a mid-level sequence, it develops specific aspects of urban life and infrastructure.

The sequence includes 10 patterns, representing a comprehensive design process within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Towns sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 9 of 15 sequences in Towns category
- **Scope**: Developmental patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Towns sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence establishes constraints and context for Buildings patterns:
- Sets spatial boundaries and site conditions
- Defines community context and social requirements
- Establishes circulation and access frameworks

The patterns in this sequence must be considered before detailed building design begins, as they establish the essential context within which buildings will exist.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Towns category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During regional planning and urban development
- When establishing community structure and character
- At the beginning of large-scale design processes

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
