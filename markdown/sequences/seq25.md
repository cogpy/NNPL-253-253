## Overview

Sequence 25 focuses on arrange the gardens, and the places in the gardens

## Emergent Phenomena

Gardens that extend the life of the building and provide connection to nature

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 7 patterns:

1. **Pattern 183: WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE**
   - Addresses: People cannot work effectively if their workspace is too enclosed or too exposed. A good workspace strikes the balance.

2. **Pattern 184: COOKING LAYOUT**
   - Addresses: Cooking is uncomfortable if the kitchen counter is too short and also if it is too long.

3. **Pattern 185: SITTING CIRCLE**
   - Addresses: A group of chairs, a sofa and a chair, a pile of cushions - these are the most obvious things in everybody's life and yet to make them work, so people become animated and alive in them, is a very subt...

4. **Pattern 186: COMMUNAL SLEEPING**
   - Addresses: In many traditional and primitive cultures, sleep is a communal activity without the sexual overtones it has in the West today. We believe that it may be a vital social function, which plays a role as...

5. **Pattern 187: MARRIAGE BED**
   - Addresses: The bed is the center of a couple's life together: the place where they lie together, talk, make love, sleep, sleep late, take care of each other during illness. But beds and bedrooms are not often ma...

6. **Pattern 188: BED ALCOVE**
   - Addresses: Bedrooms make no sense.

7. **Pattern 189: DRESSING ROOM**
   - Addresses: Dressing and undressing, storing clothes, having clothes lying around, have no reason to be part of any larger complex of activities. Indeed they disturb other activities: they are so self-contained t...


The sequence flows from workspace enclosure to dressing room, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE**: People cannot work effectively if their workspace is too enclosed or too exposed. A good workspace strikes the balance.

2. **COOKING LAYOUT**: Cooking is uncomfortable if the kitchen counter is too short and also if it is too long.

3. **SITTING CIRCLE**: A group of chairs, a sofa and a chair, a pile of cushions - these are the most obvious things in everybody's life and yet to make them work, so people become animated and alive in them, is a very subtle business. Most seating arrangements are sterile, people avoid them, nothing ever happens there. Others seem somehow to gather life around them, to concentrate and liberate energy. What is the difference between the two?

4. **COMMUNAL SLEEPING**: In many traditional and primitive cultures, sleep is a communal activity without the sexual overtones it has in the West today. We believe that it may be a vital social function, which plays a role as fundamental and as necessary to people as communal eating.

5. **MARRIAGE BED**: The bed is the center of a couple's life together: the place where they lie together, talk, make love, sleep, sleep late, take care of each other during illness. But beds and bedrooms are not often made in ways which intensify their meaning, and these experiences cannot take hold.

6. **BED ALCOVE**: Bedrooms make no sense.

7. **DRESSING ROOM**: Dressing and undressing, storing clothes, having clothes lying around, have no reason to be part of any larger complex of activities. Indeed they disturb other activities: they are so self-contained that they themselves need concentrated space which has no other function.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE**: Give each workspace an area of at least 60 square feet. Build walls and windows round each workspace to such an extent that their total area (counting windows at one-half) is 50 to 75 per cent of the full enclosure that would be there if all four walls around the 60 square feet were solid. Let the front of the workspace be open for at least 8 feet in front, always into a larger space. Place the desk so that the person working at it has a view out, either to the front or to the side. If there are other people working nearby, arrange the enclosure so that the person has a sense of connection to two or three others; but never put more than eight workspaces within view or earshot of one another.

2. **COOKING LAYOUT**: To strike the balance between the kitchen which is too small, and the kitchen which is too spread out, place the stove, sink, and food storage and counter in such a way that: 1. No two of the four are more than 10 feet apart. 2. The total length of counter - excluding sink, stove, and refrigerator - is at least 12 feet. 3. No one section of the counter is less than 4 feet long. There is no need for the counter to be continuous or entirely "built-in" as it is in many modem kitchens - it can even consist of free-standing tables or counter tops. Only the three functional relationships described above are critical.

3. **SITTING CIRCLE**: Place each sitting space in a position which is protected, not cut by paths or movement, roughly circular, made so that the room itself helps to suggest the circle - not too strongly - with paths and activities around it, so that people naturally gravitate toward the chairs when they get into the mood to sit. Place the chairs and cushions loosely in the circle, and have a few too many.

4. **COMMUNAL SLEEPING**: Arrange the sleeping area so that there is the possibility for children and adults to sleep in the same space, in sight and sound of one another, at least as an occasional alternative to their more usual sleeping habits. This can be done in the common area near the fireplace, where the entire household and guests can sleep together one large mat and some blankets in an alcove. It is also possible to build bed alcoves for overnight guests, in an extended couple's realm.

5. **MARRIAGE BED**: At the right moment in a couple's life, it is important that they make for themselves a special bed - an intimate anchor point for their lives; slightly enclosed, with a low ceiling or a canopy, with the room shaped to it; perhaps a tiny room built around the bed with many windows. Give the bed some shape of its own, perhaps as a fourposter with head board that can be hand carved or painted over the years.

6. **BED ALCOVE**: Don't put single beds in empty rooms called bedrooms, but instead put individual bed alcoves off rooms with other nonsleeping functions, so the bed itself becomes a tiny private haven. If you are building a very small house no more than 300 or 400 square feet - perhaps with the idea of adding to it gradually - this pattern plays an essential role. It will probably be best then to put the alcoves off the family room.

7. **DRESSING ROOM**: Give everyone a dressing room-either private or shared - between their bed and the bathing room. Make this dressing room big enough so there is an open area in it at least six feet in diameter; about six linear feet of clothes hanging space; and another six feet of open shelves; two or three drawers; and a mirror.


## Relationship to Buildings Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Building arrangement, spatial organization, room configuration, and indoor-outdoor transitions

**Purpose**: These patterns guide the design of individual buildings and building groups, creating spaces that support human activities, facilitate social interaction, and connect meaningfully with their surroundings.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Buildings patterns bridge between the large-scale structure established by Towns patterns and the detailed construction specified by Construction patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence operates at the Building complex to room scale (Patterns 95-204) level within the Buildings category. It addresses the internal organization and refinement of building spaces.

The sequence includes 7 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Buildings sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 10 of 13 sequences in Buildings category
- **Scope**: Refinement patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Buildings sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence bridges between Towns and Construction:
- **From Towns**: Inherits site conditions, community context, and spatial constraints
- **To Construction**: Provides spatial requirements, structural implications, and material needs

The patterns operate at the critical middle scale where urban context meets physical construction.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Buildings category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During building design and site planning
- When organizing spaces and circulation
- After Towns patterns establish context

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
