## Overview

Sequence 10 focuses on local road and path network

## Emergent Phenomena

Path networks that prioritize pedestrians while accommodating necessary vehicle access

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 7 patterns:

1. **Pattern 51: GREEN STREETS**
   - Addresses: There is too much hot hard asphalt in the world. A local road, which only gives access to buildings, needs a few stones for the wheels of the cars; nothing more. Most of it can still be green.

2. **Pattern 52: NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS**
   - Addresses: Cars are dangerous to pedestrians; yet activities occur just where cars and pedestrians meet.

3. **Pattern 53: MAIN GATEWAYS**
   - Addresses: Any part of a town - large or small - which is to be identified by its inhabitants as a precinct of some kind, will be reinforced, helped in its distinctness, marked, and made more vivid, if the paths...

4. **Pattern 54: ROAD CROSSING**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

5. **Pattern 55: RAISED WALK**
   - Addresses: Where fast moving cars and pedestrians meet in cities, the cars overwhelm the pedestrians. The car is king, and people are made to feel small.

6. **Pattern 56: BIKE PATHS AND RACKS**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

7. **Pattern 57: CHILDREN IN THE CITY**
   - Addresses: If children are not able to explore the whole of the adult world round about them, they cannot become adults. But modern cities are so dangerous that children cannot be allowed to explore them freely.


The sequence flows from green streets to children in the city, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **GREEN STREETS**: There is too much hot hard asphalt in the world. A local road, which only gives access to buildings, needs a few stones for the wheels of the cars; nothing more. Most of it can still be green.

2. **NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS**: Cars are dangerous to pedestrians; yet activities occur just where cars and pedestrians meet.

3. **MAIN GATEWAYS**: Any part of a town - large or small - which is to be identified by its inhabitants as a precinct of some kind, will be reinforced, helped in its distinctness, marked, and made more vivid, if the paths which enter it are marked by gateways where they cross the boundary.

4. **ROAD CROSSING**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

5. **RAISED WALK**: Where fast moving cars and pedestrians meet in cities, the cars overwhelm the pedestrians. The car is king, and people are made to feel small.

6. **BIKE PATHS AND RACKS**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

7. **CHILDREN IN THE CITY**: If children are not able to explore the whole of the adult world round about them, they cannot become adults. But modern cities are so dangerous that children cannot be allowed to explore them freely.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **GREEN STREETS**: On local roads, closed to through traffic, plant grass all over the road and set occasional paving stones into the grass to form a surface for the wheels of those cars that need access to the street. Make no distinction between street and, sidewalk. Where houses open off the street, put in more paving stones or gravel to let cars turn onto their own land.

2. **NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS**: Except where traffic densities are very high or very low, lay out pedestrian paths at right angles to roads, not along them, so that the paths gradually begin to form a second network, distinct from the road system, and orthogonal to it. This can be done quite gradually - even if you put in one path at a time, but always put them in the middle of the "block," so that they run across the roads.

3. **MAIN GATEWAYS**: Mark every boundary in the city which has important human meaning - the boundary of a building cluster, a neighborhood, a precinct - by great gateways where the major entering paths cross the boundary.

4. **ROAD CROSSING**: ## Problem

Where paths cross roads, the cars have power to frighten and subdue the people walking, even when the people walking have the legal right-of-way.

5. **RAISED WALK**: We conclude that any pedestrian path along a road carrying fast-moving cars should be about 18 inches above the road, with a low wall or railing, or balustrade along the edge, to mark the edge. Put the raised walk on only one side of the road - make it as wide as possible.

6. **BIKE PATHS AND RACKS**: ## Problem

Bikes are cheap, healthy, and good for the environment; but the environment is not designed for them. Bikes on roads are threatened by cars; bikes on paths threaten pedestrians.

7. **CHILDREN IN THE CITY**: As part of the network of bike paths, develop one system of paths that is extra safe---entirely separate from automobiles, with lights and bridges at the crossings, with homes and shops along it, so that there are always many eyes on the path. Let this path go through every neighborhood, so that children can get onto it without crossing a main road. And run the path all through the city, down pedestrian streets, through workshops, assembly plants, warehouses, interchanges, print houses, bakeries, all the interesting "invisible" life of a town - so that the children can roam freely on their bikes and trikes.


## Relationship to Towns Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Large-scale urban planning, regional development, community structure, and public spaces

**Purpose**: These patterns establish the fundamental structure of human settlements from regions down to neighborhoods, ensuring balanced distribution of population, preservation of natural systems, and creation of identifiable communities.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Towns patterns form the foundation of the pattern language, creating the overall framework within which buildings and construction details must fit.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence contributes to the Towns category by establishing patterns at the Regional to neighborhood scale (Patterns 1-94) level. As a mid-level sequence, it develops specific aspects of urban life and infrastructure.

The sequence includes 7 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Towns sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 10 of 15 sequences in Towns category
- **Scope**: Developmental patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Towns sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence establishes constraints and context for Buildings patterns:
- Sets spatial boundaries and site conditions
- Defines community context and social requirements
- Establishes circulation and access frameworks

The patterns in this sequence must be considered before detailed building design begins, as they establish the essential context within which buildings will exist.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Towns category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During regional planning and urban development
- When establishing community structure and character
- At the beginning of large-scale design processes

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
