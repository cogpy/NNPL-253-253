## Overview

Sequence 20 focuses on gradients and connection of space

## Emergent Phenomena

Spatial sequences that create privacy gradients and support different types of activities

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 11 patterns:

1. **Pattern 132: SHORT PASSAGES**
   - Addresses: ". . . long, sterile corridors set the scene for everything bad about modern architecture."

2. **Pattern 133: STAIRCASE AS A STAGE**
   - Addresses: A staircase is not just a way of getting from one floor to another. The stair is itself a space, a volume, a part of the building; and unless this space is made to live, it will be a dead spot, and wo...

3. **Pattern 134: ZEN VIEW**
   - Addresses: The archetypal zen view occurs in a famous Japanese house, which gives this pattern its name.

4. **Pattern 135: TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK**
   - Addresses: In a building with uniform light level, there are few "places" which function as effective settings for human events. This happens because, to a large extent, the places which make effective settings ...

5. **Pattern 136: COUPLE'S REALM**
   - Addresses: The presence of children in a family often destroys the closeness and the special privacy which a man and wife need together.

6. **Pattern 137: CHILDREN'S REALM**
   - Addresses: If children do not have space to release a tremendous amount of energy when they need to, they will drive themselves and everybody else in the family up the wall.

7. **Pattern 138: SLEEPING TO THE EAST**
   - Addresses: This is one of the patterns people most often disagree with. However, we believe they are mistaken.

8. **Pattern 139: FARMHOUSE KITCHEN**
   - Addresses: The isolated kitchen, separate from the family and considered as an efficient but unpleasant factory for food is a hangover from the days of servants; and from the more recent days when women willingl...

9. **Pattern 140: PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET**
   - Addresses: The relationship of a house to a street is often confused: either the house opens entirely to the street and there is no privacy; or the house turns its back on the street, and communion with street l...

10. **Pattern 141: A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN**
   - Addresses: No one can be close to others, without also having frequent opportunities to be alone.

11. **Pattern 142: SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES**
   - Addresses: Every corner of a building is a potential sitting space. But each sitting space has different needs for comfort and enclosure according to its position in the intimacy gradient.


The sequence flows from short passages to sequence of sitting spaces, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **SHORT PASSAGES**: ". . . long, sterile corridors set the scene for everything bad about modern architecture."

2. **STAIRCASE AS A STAGE**: A staircase is not just a way of getting from one floor to another. The stair is itself a space, a volume, a part of the building; and unless this space is made to live, it will be a dead spot, and work to disconnect the building and to tear its processes apart.

3. **ZEN VIEW**: The archetypal zen view occurs in a famous Japanese house, which gives this pattern its name.

4. **TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK**: In a building with uniform light level, there are few "places" which function as effective settings for human events. This happens because, to a large extent, the places which make effective settings are defined by light.

5. **COUPLE'S REALM**: The presence of children in a family often destroys the closeness and the special privacy which a man and wife need together.

6. **CHILDREN'S REALM**: If children do not have space to release a tremendous amount of energy when they need to, they will drive themselves and everybody else in the family up the wall.

7. **SLEEPING TO THE EAST**: This is one of the patterns people most often disagree with. However, we believe they are mistaken.

8. **FARMHOUSE KITCHEN**: The isolated kitchen, separate from the family and considered as an efficient but unpleasant factory for food is a hangover from the days of servants; and from the more recent days when women willingly took over the servants' role.

9. **PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET**: The relationship of a house to a street is often confused: either the house opens entirely to the street and there is no privacy; or the house turns its back on the street, and communion with street life is lost.

10. **A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN**: No one can be close to others, without also having frequent opportunities to be alone.

11. **SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES**: Every corner of a building is a potential sitting space. But each sitting space has different needs for comfort and enclosure according to its position in the intimacy gradient.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **SHORT PASSAGES**: Keep passages short. Make them as much like rooms as possible, with carpets or wood on the floor, furniture, bookshelves, beautiful windows. Make them generous in shape, and always give them plenty of light; the best corridors and passages of all are those which have windows along an entire wall.

2. **STAIRCASE AS A STAGE**: Place the main stair in a key position, central and visible. Treat the whole staircase as a room (or if it is outside, as a courtyard). Arrange it so that the stair and the room are one, with the stair coming down around one or two walls of the room. Flare out the bottom of the stair with open windows or balustrades and with wide-steps so that the people coming down the stair become part of the action in the room while they are on the stair, and so that people below will naturally use the stair for seats.

3. **ZEN VIEW**: If there is a beautiful view, don't spoil it by building huge windows that gape incessantly at it. Instead, put the windows which look onto the view at places of transitionalong paths, in hallways, in entry ways, on stairs, between rooms. If the view window is correctly placed, people will see a glimpse of the distant view as they come up to the window or pass it: but the view is never visible from the places where people stay.

4. **TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK**: Create alternating areas of light and dark throughout the building, in such a way that people naturally walk toward the light, whenever they are going to important places: seats, entrances, stairs, passages, places of special beauty, and make other areas darker, to increase the contrast.

5. **COUPLE'S REALM**: Make a special part of the house distinct from the common areas and all the children's rooms, where the man and woman of the house can be together in private. Give this place a quick path to the children's rooms, but, at all costs, make it a distinctly separate realm.

6. **CHILDREN'S REALM**: Start by placing the small area which will belong entirely to the children - the cluster of their beds. Place it in a separate position toward the back of the house, and in such a way that a continuous playspace can be made from this cluster to the street, almost like a wide swath inside the house, muddy, toys strewn along the way, touching those family rooms which children need - the bathroom and the kitchen most of all - passing the common area along one side (but leaving quiet sitting areas and the couple's realm entirely separate and inviolate), reaching out to the street, either through its own door or through the entrance room, and ending in an outdoor room, connected to the street, and sheltered, and large enough so that the children can play in it when it rains, yet still be outdoors.

7. **SLEEPING TO THE EAST**: Give those parts of the house where people sleep, an eastern orientation, so that they wake up with the sun and light. This means, typically, that the sleeping area needs to be on the eastern side of the house; but it can also be on the western side provided there is a courtyard or a terrace to the east of it.

8. **FARMHOUSE KITCHEN**: Make the kitchen bigger than usual, big enough to include the "family room" space, and place it near the center of the commons, not so far back in the house as an ordinary kitchen. Make it large enough to hold a good big table and chairs, some soft and some hard, with counters and stove and sink around the edge of the room; and make it a bright and comfortable room.

9. **PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET**: Let the common rooms open onto a wide terrace or a porch which looks into the street. Raise the terrace slightly above street level and protect it with a low wall, which you can see over if you sit near it, but which prevents people on the street from looking into the common rooms.

10. **A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN**: Give each member of the family a room of his own, especially adults. A minimum room of one's own is an alcove with desk, shelves, and curtain. The maximum is a cottage - like a TEENAGER'S COTTAGE (154), or an OLD AGE COTTAGE (155). In all cases, especially the adult ones, place these rooms at the far ends of the intimacy gradient - far from the common rooms.

11. **SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES**: Put in a sequence of graded sitting spaces throughout the building, varying according to their degree of enclosure. Enclose the most formal ones entirely, in rooms by themselves; put the least formal ones in corners of other rooms, without any kind of screen around them; and place the intermediate one with a partial enclosure round them to keep them connected to some larger space, but also partly separate.


## Relationship to Buildings Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Building arrangement, spatial organization, room configuration, and indoor-outdoor transitions

**Purpose**: These patterns guide the design of individual buildings and building groups, creating spaces that support human activities, facilitate social interaction, and connect meaningfully with their surroundings.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Buildings patterns bridge between the large-scale structure established by Towns patterns and the detailed construction specified by Construction patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence operates at the Building complex to room scale (Patterns 95-204) level within the Buildings category. It focuses on the arrangement and positioning of buildings and their outdoor spaces.

The sequence includes 11 patterns, representing a comprehensive design process within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Buildings sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 5 of 13 sequences in Buildings category
- **Scope**: Developmental patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Buildings sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence bridges between Towns and Construction:
- **From Towns**: Inherits site conditions, community context, and spatial constraints
- **To Construction**: Provides spatial requirements, structural implications, and material needs

The patterns operate at the critical middle scale where urban context meets physical construction.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Buildings category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During building design and site planning
- When organizing spaces and circulation
- After Towns patterns establish context

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
