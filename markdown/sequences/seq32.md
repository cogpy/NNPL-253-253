## Metadata

- **Category**: Construction

- **Pattern Count**: 5

## Overview

Sequence 32 focuses on fix the exact positions for openings and frame them

## Emergent Phenomena

Window and door openings positioned to support both structure and spatial quality

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 5 patterns:

1. **Pattern 221: NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

2. **Pattern 222: LOW SILL**
   - Addresses: One of a window's most important functions is to put you in touch with the outdoors. If the sill is too high, it cuts you off.

3. **Pattern 223: DEEP REVEALS**
   - Addresses: Windows with a sharp edge where the frame meets the wall create harsh, blinding glare, and make the rooms they serve uncomfortable.

4. **Pattern 224: LOW DOORWAY**
   - Addresses: High doorways are simple and convenient. But a lower door is often more profound.

5. **Pattern 225: FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.


The sequence flows from natural doors and windows to frames as thickened edges, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

2. **LOW SILL**: One of a window's most important functions is to put you in touch with the outdoors. If the sill is too high, it cuts you off.

3. **DEEP REVEALS**: Windows with a sharp edge where the frame meets the wall create harsh, blinding glare, and make the rooms they serve uncomfortable.

4. **LOW DOORWAY**: High doorways are simple and convenient. But a lower door is often more profound.

5. **FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS**: ## Problem

Finding the right position for a window or a door is a subtle matter. But there are very few ways of building which take this into consideration.

2. **LOW SILL**: When determining exact location of windows also decide which windows should have low sills. On the first floor, make the sills of windows which you plan to sit by between 12 and 14 inches high. On the upper stories, make them higher, around 20 inches.

3. **DEEP REVEALS**: Make the window frame a deep, splayed edge: about a foot wide and splayed at about 50 to 60 degrees to the plane of the window, so that the gentle gradient of daylight gives a smooth transition between the light of the window and the dark of the inner wall.

4. **LOW DOORWAY**: Instead of taking it for granted that your doors are simply 6' 8" rectangular openings to pass through, make at least some of your doorways low enough so that the act of going through the door is a deliberate thoughtful passage from one place to another. Especially at the entrance to a house, at the entrance to a private room, or a fire cornermake the doorway lower than usual, perhaps even as low as 5" 8".

5. **FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES**: ## Problem

Any homogeneous membrane which has holes in it will tend to rupture at the holes, unless the edges of the holes are reinforced by thickening.


## Relationship to Construction Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Structural systems, materials, construction methods, and architectural details

**Purpose**: These patterns specify the physical construction and material details that bring buildings to life, ensuring structural integrity while creating beauty and human comfort.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Construction patterns complete the pattern language by providing the detailed specifications needed to actually build the spaces envisioned in Towns and Buildings patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence works at the Structural system to detail scale (Patterns 205-253) level within the Construction category. It specifies the detailed elements and finishes that complete the construction.

The sequence includes 5 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Construction sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 4 of 8 sequences in Construction category
- **Scope**: Developmental patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Construction sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence realizes the intentions established by Towns and Buildings patterns:
- Translates spatial concepts into physical structure
- Specifies materials and construction methods
- Creates the tactile and visual details that inhabitants experience

These patterns complete the pattern language by making abstract spatial ideas into concrete reality.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Construction category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During construction documentation and detailing
- When specifying materials and methods
- After spatial organization is established

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
