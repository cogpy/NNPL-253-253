## Overview

Sequence 28 focuses on give the walls some depth

## Emergent Phenomena

Walls with depth that provide storage, seating, and architectural richness

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 8 patterns:

1. **Pattern 197: THICK WALLS**
   - Addresses: Houses with smooth hard walls made of prefabricated panels, concrete, gypsum, steel, aluminum, or glass always stay impersonal and dead.

2. **Pattern 198: CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS**
   - Addresses: The provision of storage and closets usually comes as an afterthought.

3. **Pattern 199: SUNNY COUNTER**
   - Addresses: Dark gloomy kitchens are depressing. The kitchen needs the sun more than the other rooms, not less.

4. **Pattern 200: OPEN SHELVES**
   - Addresses: Cupboards that are too deep waste valuable space, and it always seems that what you want is behind something else.

5. **Pattern 201: WAIST-HIGH SHELF**
   - Addresses: In every house and every workplace there is a daily "traffic" of the objects which are handled most. Unless such things are immediately at hand, the flow of life is awkward, full of mistakes; things a...

6. **Pattern 202: BUILT-IN SEATS**
   - Addresses: Built-in seats are great. Everybody loves them. They make a building feel comfortable and luxurious. But most often they do not actually work. They are placed wrong, or too narrow, or the back does no...

7. **Pattern 203: CHILD CAVES**
   - Addresses: Children love to be in tiny, cave-like places.

8. **Pattern 204: SECRET PLACE**
   - Addresses: Where can the need for concealment be expressed; the need to hide; the need for something precious to be lost, and then revealed?


The sequence flows from thick walls to secret place, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **THICK WALLS**: Houses with smooth hard walls made of prefabricated panels, concrete, gypsum, steel, aluminum, or glass always stay impersonal and dead.

2. **CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS**: The provision of storage and closets usually comes as an afterthought.

3. **SUNNY COUNTER**: Dark gloomy kitchens are depressing. The kitchen needs the sun more than the other rooms, not less.

4. **OPEN SHELVES**: Cupboards that are too deep waste valuable space, and it always seems that what you want is behind something else.

5. **WAIST-HIGH SHELF**: In every house and every workplace there is a daily "traffic" of the objects which are handled most. Unless such things are immediately at hand, the flow of life is awkward, full of mistakes; things are forgotten, misplaced.

6. **BUILT-IN SEATS**: Built-in seats are great. Everybody loves them. They make a building feel comfortable and luxurious. But most often they do not actually work. They are placed wrong, or too narrow, or the back does not slope, or the view is wrong, or the seat is too hard. This pattern tells you what to do to make a built-in seat that really works.

7. **CHILD CAVES**: Children love to be in tiny, cave-like places.

8. **SECRET PLACE**: Where can the need for concealment be expressed; the need to hide; the need for something precious to be lost, and then revealed?

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **THICK WALLS**: Open your mind to the possibility that the walls of your building can be thick, can occupy a substantial volume - even actual usable space - and need not be merely thin membranes which have no depth. Decide where these thick walls ought to be.

2. **CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS**: Mark all the rooms where you want closets. Then place the closets themselves on those interior walls which lie between two rooms and between rooms and passages where you need acoustic insulation. Place them so as to create transition spaces for the doors into the rooms. On no account put closets on exterior walls. It wastes the opportunity for good acoustic insulation and cuts off precious light.

3. **SUNNY COUNTER**: Place the main part of the kitchen counter on the south and southeast side of the kitchen, with big windows around it, so that sun can flood in and fill the kitchen with yellow light both morning and afternoon.

4. **OPEN SHELVES**: Cover the walls with narrow shelves of varying depth but always shallow enough so that things can be placed on them one deep - nothing hiding behind anything else.

5. **WAIST-HIGH SHELF**: Build waist-high shelves around at least a part of the main rooms where people live and work. Make them long, 9 to 15 inches deep, with shelves or cupboard underneath. Interrupt the shelf for seats, windows, and doors.

6. **BUILT-IN SEATS**: Before you build the seat, get hold of an old arm chair or a sofa, and put it into the position where you intend to build a seat. Move it until you really like it. Leave it there for a few days. See if you enjoy sitting in it. Move it if you don't. When you have got it into a position which you like, and where you often find yourself sitting, you know it is a good position. Now build a seat that is just as wide, and just as well padded - and your built-in seat will work.

7. **CHILD CAVES**: Wherever children play, around the house, in the neighborhood, in schools, make small "caves" for them. Tuck these caves away in natural left over spaces, under stairs, under kitchen counters. Keep the ceiling heights low - 2 feet 6 inches to 4 feet - and the entrance tiny.

8. **SECRET PLACE**: Make a place in the house, perhaps only a few feet square, which is kept locked and secret; a place which is virtually impossible to discover - until you have been shown where it is; a place where the archives of the house, or other more potent secrets, might be kept.


## Relationship to Buildings Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Building arrangement, spatial organization, room configuration, and indoor-outdoor transitions

**Purpose**: These patterns guide the design of individual buildings and building groups, creating spaces that support human activities, facilitate social interaction, and connect meaningfully with their surroundings.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Buildings patterns bridge between the large-scale structure established by Towns patterns and the detailed construction specified by Construction patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence operates at the Building complex to room scale (Patterns 95-204) level within the Buildings category. It deals with detailed spatial and structural refinements that complete the building design.

The sequence includes 8 patterns, representing a comprehensive design process within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Buildings sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 13 of 13 sequences in Buildings category
- **Scope**: Refinement patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Buildings sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence bridges between Towns and Construction:
- **From Towns**: Inherits site conditions, community context, and spatial constraints
- **To Construction**: Provides spatial requirements, structural implications, and material needs

The patterns operate at the critical middle scale where urban context meets physical construction.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Buildings category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During building design and site planning
- When organizing spaces and circulation
- After Towns patterns establish context

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
