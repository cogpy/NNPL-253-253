## Overview

Sequence 26 focuses on inside, attach necessary minor rooms and alcoves

## Emergent Phenomena

Secondary spaces that support the main activities without overwhelming them

This emergent property arises from the synergistic interaction of the patterns in this sequence. While each pattern addresses specific problems, their combination creates a higher-order quality that transcends individual pattern effects.

## The Algorithm: Flow and Sequence

This sequence represents a coherent design algorithm that unfolds across 7 patterns:

1. **Pattern 190: CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY**
   - Addresses: A building in which the ceiling heights are all the same is virtually incapable of making people comfortable.

2. **Pattern 191: THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE**
   - Addresses: The perfectly crystalline squares and rectangles of ultramodern architecture make no special sense in human or in structural terms. They only express the rigid desires and fantasies which people have ...

3. **Pattern 192: WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE**
   - Addresses: Rooms without a view are prisons for the people who have to stay in them.

4. **Pattern 193: HALF-OPEN WALL**
   - Addresses: Rooms which are too closed prevent the natural flow of social occasions, and the natural process of transition from one social moment to another. And rooms which are too open will not support the diff...

5. **Pattern 194: INTERIOR WINDOWS**
   - Addresses: Windows are most often used to create connections between the indoor and the outdoors. But there are many cases when an indoor space needs a connecting window to another indoor space.

6. **Pattern 195: STAIRCASE VOLUME**
   - Addresses: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

7. **Pattern 196: CORNER DOORS**
   - Addresses: The success of a room depends to a great extent on the position of the doors. If the doors create a pattern of movement which destroys the places in the room, the room will never allow people to be co...


The sequence flows from ceiling height variety to corner doors, with each pattern building upon and refining the previous ones. This progressive refinement ensures that larger structural decisions inform and constrain smaller detailed decisions, maintaining coherence across scales.

## Aggregated Problem-Solution Pairs

### Collective Problem Statement

This sequence addresses a family of related problems:

1. **CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY**: A building in which the ceiling heights are all the same is virtually incapable of making people comfortable.

2. **THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE**: The perfectly crystalline squares and rectangles of ultramodern architecture make no special sense in human or in structural terms. They only express the rigid desires and fantasies which people have when they get too preoccupied with systems and the means of their production.

3. **WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE**: Rooms without a view are prisons for the people who have to stay in them.

4. **HALF-OPEN WALL**: Rooms which are too closed prevent the natural flow of social occasions, and the natural process of transition from one social moment to another. And rooms which are too open will not support the differentiation of events which social life requires.

5. **INTERIOR WINDOWS**: Windows are most often used to create connections between the indoor and the outdoors. But there are many cases when an indoor space needs a connecting window to another indoor space.

6. **STAIRCASE VOLUME**: This pattern addresses a fundamental need in the system.

7. **CORNER DOORS**: The success of a room depends to a great extent on the position of the doors. If the doors create a pattern of movement which destroys the places in the room, the room will never allow people to be comfortable.

### Integrated Solution Strategy

The sequence provides an integrated approach through these solutions:

1. **CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY**: Vary the ceiling heights continuously throughout the building, especially between rooms which open into each other, so that the relative intimacy of different spaces can be felt. In particular, make ceilings high in rooms which are public or meant for large gatherings (10 to 12 feet), lower in rooms for smaller gatherings (7 to 9 feet), and very low in rooms or alcoves for one or two people (6 to 7 feet).

2. **THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE**: With occasional exceptions, make each indoor space or each position of a space, a rough rectangle, with roughly straight walls, near right angles in the corners, and a roughly symmetrical vault over each room.

3. **WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE**: In each room, place the windows in such a way that their total area conforms roughly to the appropriate figures for your region (25 per cent or more of floor area, in the San Francisco Bay Area), and place them in positions which give the best possible views out over life: activities in streets, quiet gardens, anything different from the indoor scene.

4. **HALF-OPEN WALL**: Adjust the walls, openings, and windows in each indoor space until you reach the right balance between open, flowing space and closed cell-like space. Do not take it for granted that each space is a room; nor, on the other hand, that all spaces must flow into each other. The right balance will always lie between these extremes: no one room entirely enclosed; and no space totally connected to another. Use combinations of columns, half-open walls, porches, indoor windows, sliding doors, low sills, french doors, sitting walls, and so on, to hit the right balance.

5. **INTERIOR WINDOWS**: Put in fully glazed fixed windows between rooms which tend to be dead because they have too little action in them or where inside rooms are unusually dark.

6. **STAIRCASE VOLUME**: ## Problem

We are putting this pattern in the language because our experiments have shown us that lay people often make mistakes about the volume which a staircase needs and therefore make their plans unbuildable.

7. **CORNER DOORS**: Except in very large rooms, a door only rarely makes sense in the middle of a wall. It does in an entrance room, for instance, because this room gets its character essentially from the door. But in most rooms, especially small ones, put the doors as near the corners of the room as possible. If the room has two doors, and people move through it, keep both doors at one end of the room.


## Relationship to Buildings Category

### Category Context

**Focus**: Building arrangement, spatial organization, room configuration, and indoor-outdoor transitions

**Purpose**: These patterns guide the design of individual buildings and building groups, creating spaces that support human activities, facilitate social interaction, and connect meaningfully with their surroundings.

**Role in Pattern Language**: Buildings patterns bridge between the large-scale structure established by Towns patterns and the detailed construction specified by Construction patterns.

### Sequence's Role in Category

This sequence operates at the Building complex to room scale (Patterns 95-204) level within the Buildings category. It addresses the internal organization and refinement of building spaces.

The sequence includes 7 patterns, representing a moderate-scale transformation within this scale range.


## Integration with Pattern Language

### Horizontal Relationships (Within Category)

This sequence works alongside other Buildings sequences to create a complete picture at this scale:

- **Position**: 11 of 13 sequences in Buildings category
- **Scope**: Refinement patterns
- **Coordination**: Works with other Buildings sequences to ensure comprehensive coverage of this scale


### Vertical Relationships (Across Categories)

This sequence bridges between Towns and Construction:
- **From Towns**: Inherits site conditions, community context, and spatial constraints
- **To Construction**: Provides spatial requirements, structural implications, and material needs

The patterns operate at the critical middle scale where urban context meets physical construction.

### Network Effects

The patterns in this sequence don't work in isolation. They create a network of relationships:

1. **Internal Synergy**: Patterns within this sequence reinforce and complete each other
2. **Category Integration**: The sequence contributes to the overall coherence of the Buildings category
3. **Cross-Category Bridges**: Patterns connect to patterns in other categories, ensuring consistency across scales
4. **Emergent Properties**: The combination creates qualities that no single pattern could achieve alone

### Usage Guidance

**When to Apply This Sequence**:
- During building design and site planning
- When organizing spaces and circulation
- After Towns patterns establish context

**How to Apply**:
1. Review the entire sequence to understand the flow
2. Apply patterns in order, allowing each to inform the next
3. Look for the emergent phenomena to verify successful integration
4. Cross-reference with related sequences in other categories

**Key Success Indicators**:
- The emergent phenomena becomes visible and palpable
- Patterns reinforce rather than contradict each other
- The sequence creates a coherent whole, not just a collection of parts
- Solutions at this scale appropriately constrain and enable solutions at other scales
