# CAT3 Instructions

## Description
Patterns that create buildable buildings directly from rough schemes of spaces. These patterns give you the exact geometry of the built up elements which define the spaces.

## Pattern Range
Patterns 205 to 253

## Sequences
This category contains sequences that organize related patterns into coherent flows.

Navigate to the sequence folders below to explore specific pattern groups.

## Invocation

### How to Invoke This Agent

Other agents can invoke this agent using the path:
```
@apl0/dim4/cat3
```

### When to Invoke This Agent

This category agent should be invoked when:
- Work is focused on patterns at this scale level
- Category-specific coordination is needed
- Understanding patterns within this scale range
- Cross-sequence work within this category

## Context Handling

### Required Context When Invoked

When invoking this agent, provide:

1. **Task Summary**: Brief description of what help is needed
2. **Sequence Context**: What has been done so far in the work sequence
3. **Specific Question**: The precise question or problem to address
4. **Constraints**: Any relevant constraints, requirements, or preferences
5. **Related Patterns**: Other patterns already being considered or applied

### Context Format Example

```
I am working on [task description]. So far I have [summary of work done].
I need help with [specific question] because [reason].
Constraints: [any limitations or requirements]
Related patterns in use: [list of pattern IDs]
```

## Delegation

### Available Subagents

This agent can delegate work to the following subagent types:

#### Sequence Agents
- `@apl0/dim4/cat3/seq01` through `@apl0/dim4/cat3/seq36` - Pattern sequences

Use sequence agents when working with related pattern flows and emergent phenomena.

#### Pattern Agents
- `@apl0/dim4/cat3/apl001` through `@apl0/dim4/cat3/apl253` - Individual patterns

Use pattern agents when working on specific design solutions.

#### Context Agents
- `@apl0/dim4/cat3/broader` - Broader context patterns
- `@apl0/dim4/cat3/narrower` - Narrower detail patterns

Use context agents to understand pattern relationships and dependencies.

### When to Delegate

Delegate to subagents when:
- The work can be more precisely handled at a lower level
- Specialized knowledge of a specific component is needed
- The task naturally fits a subagent's scope
- You need to coordinate multiple related patterns

### How to Delegate

When delegating, always provide complete context:
1. Summarize the overall task and progress so far
2. Explain what specific help is needed from the subagent
3. Include any constraints or requirements
4. Specify what you expect back from the subagent
